2,"Planning, stress and worry put the mental load on mothers – will 2022 be the year they share the burden?",2022-01-03,,"Rich Smith/UnsplashThe COVID pandemic has made the very private issue of the domestic division of labour – the way housework and childcare are divided – a very public issue. During lockdowns, the burden of housework and childcare grew significantly for men and women in opposite-sex and same-sex couples both in Australia and elsewhere. Overnight, homes became offices, childcare centres and makeshift schools and it was mothers who largely stepped into these teaching and caring roles at the expense of their anxiety levels and sleep. While the pandemic exacerbated the physical demands of care – housework and childcare – it also exacerbated another part of the work that keeps households and families running: the mental load. Read more: COVID forced Australian fathers to do more at home, but at the same cost mothers have long endured What is the mental load? A lot has been written about the mental load over the past two years, with many confusing the mental load with household labour – cleaning and cooking or caring after children – or planning tasks involved with childcare. But the mental load is so much more. In our recently published research, we define the mental load as the combination of two types of work or labour: cognitive labour and emotional labour. The mental load is more than just planning. Vitolda Klein/Unsplash The cognitive aspect of the mental load involves the scheduling, planning, and organising required to support the smooth operating of families. This type of work ranges from organising a play date to planning dinner. We argue this cognitive work becomes a load or the mental load when it has an emotional element, for example, when there is worry or stress attached to these tasks. Some have described list-making as the mental load, but list-making isn’t always stressful or emotional and, importantly, list-making has a finite beginning and end. But, once cognitive tasks like list-making take on an emotional element – like worry about whether Nana will like her present, anxiety about how relatives will get along at holiday dinners and stress about filling stockings while finishing work – then it becomes the mental load. How does the mental load operate? We argue the mental load operates in families and societies in three ways. The mental load can be performed anywhere, anytime. Aviv Rachmadian/Unsplash First it’s invisible – it’s the type of work that is done internally. Unlike housework or childcare, it’s unseen and therefore hard to recognise. Second, the mental load is boundaryless. Because it’s invisible, it can be performed anywhere or at anytime. American sociologist Arlie Hochschild termed women’s domestic labour done after work as the “second shift” but the mental load has no shifts – it can be done before, during and after work or even during time that should be spent sleeping. And lastly, the mental load is enduring, meaning it never ends. Unlike housework such as like cooking or cleaning, thinking and caring about family members never ends, which is why the mental load can be so burdensome and Nana still reminds you to take a jacket. How can we lessen mental loads in 2022 and beyond? Individuals and society can do a number of things to decrease the mental load. 1) Make the mental load more visible by quantifying it We have no robust, standardised and nationally representative measure of the mental load. This means, unlike housework and childcare, we have no idea the volume and consequences of the mental load for Australians. Recent reports on housework show women do 21 more hours of unpaid work than men. They may also spend the bulk of the day thinking about, planning and worrying about their families. The mental load can last long after your children have left home. Clem Onojeghuo Yet, we have no measure of this labour and, importantly, we don’t know how men carry the mental load either. Quantifying and capturing how much time we spend on the mental load and how this is shared between couples will help lay the groundwork for change. 2) Acknowledge the toll on women The pandemic has left workers burnt out, stressed and overwhelmed by the intensity of balancing work, homeschooling and full-time care demands while isolated at home. It’s no wonder the pandemic has knocked mothers out of employment. Read more: Women aren't better multitaskers than men – they're just doing more work Mothers are exhausted not only from the physical demands of work and family but also the cognitive labour of holding it all together at work while worrying about torpedoing children’s educational futures from keeping them home, alone and glued to screens. The mental load, as the unrelenting internal nag, is a drain on well-being with serious consequences for economic productivity and fatigue. The mental load is a national health emergency and should be treated seriously by workplaces and governments alike. The mental load affects women’s health and productivity. Annie Spratt/Unsplash 3) Help families better reconcile work and family demands Both organisations and governments need to be better at helping families combine their work and care responsibilities. The mental load overloads women (and some men) particularly at work when they are thinking and worrying about their children’s needs. Workplaces need to improve support for families to lessen the mental load. This may mean more working remotely or concrete programs to support workers’ mental loads. This is also likely to improve workers’ productivity. Read more: As the 9-to-5 work day disappears, our lives are growing more out of sync At the same time, governments need to provide better care infrastructure to support families, for example more universal affordable childcare, supports for transitioning children to and from school, and better aged care. This will lessen workers’ worries about the experiences of loved ones while they’re engaged in paid work. Ultimately, the mental load is a mental health issue and companies and governments should treat it as such. This will unburden families, and particularly mothers, from managing the mental load alone.

3,Hitting the beach this summer? Here are some of our top animal picks to look out for,2022-01-03,,"John Turnbull, Author providedAustralia has one of the longest coastlines in the world. And it’s packed with life of all shapes and sizes – from lively dolphins leaping offshore, to tiny crabs scurrying into their holes. Here is just some of the diverse coastal life you might expect to see this summer, if you spend some time at the water’s edge. Dolphins and turtles We’re fortunate to have 15 species of dolphin (and one porpoise!) living in Australian waters. The large bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) are relatively common and can be spotted all the way around our coast. You might see them playing in the waves, jumping out of the water, or even surfing among humans. Bottlenose dolphins are generally grey with a lighter underside and have a pronounced, curved dorsal (upper) fin. Shutterstock Turtles are less obvious, but can be spotted as they bob their heads out of the water to breathe. Australia’s coasts are home to six of the world’s seven sea turtles (all listed as either vulnerable or endangered). The more common green turtle (Chelonia mydas) can be found everywhere except in the coldest southern waters. In summer, the turtles travel north to the tropical waters of QLD, NT and WA to reproduce – laying their eggs in the warm sand. Green turtles often get tangled in discarded fishing gear and nets and can die from ingesting plastics, so don’t litter! John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided Another reptile you might encounter in the eastern coastal areas is the water dragon (Intellagama lesueurii). You’ll find them hovering around beach-side picnic areas, looking for tasty treats such as flies, ants, bugs, native fruits and flowers. As with all native animals, it’s important not to feed them. Water dragons are good swimmers and stay near the water. John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided Heads in the clouds If you cast your eyes up, you’ll see many coastal bird species soaring above. Two of our favourites are the protected white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) and the sooty oystercatcher (Haematopus fuliginosus). Both rely on marine animals for food, and nest in coastal areas right around Australia. With a wingspan of up to 2m, you can find white-bellied sea eagles soaring above headlands. WikiCommons The sea eagle mostly feeds on fish, turtles and sea snakes. It was recently listed as either threatened, endangered, or vulnerable in four states, largely as a result of coastal developments. Meanwhile the sooty oystercatcher is, well, all black. It has distinctive bright-orange eyes and a long beak. Sooties can be found strutting among the seaweed and sea squirts on rocky shores. As the name suggests, these birds enjoy eating molluscs and other invertebrates. The sooty gives a loud whistling call before taking flight. John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided Crawling coastal critters Many a critter will run for cover as sooties (and humans) approach, including the swift-footed crab (Leptograpsus variegatus). This crab’s mostly purple body is sprinkled with flecks of olive, and sometimes orange. The species lives among the rocky shores around southern Australia, from WA to QLD, and even Tasmania. The swift-footed crab can grow to about 5cm in shell width. John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided You’re much less likely to see another common crab, the sand bubbler. But you might see the results of its industrious activity on flat, wet and sandy areas. Sand bubblers live in underground burrows, emerging during the low tide to filter sand through their mouthparts looking for food. In this process, they end up making little pea-sized sand balls. When the tide starts to rise again, they return to their burrows and wait in a bubble of air, which they use to breathe, until the tide recedes. Sand bubblers, from the family Dotillidae, are tiny and will quickly hide if they sense danger. John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided Magnificent molluscs Molluscs are another diverse group of marine animals on our shores, and one of the best known molluscs is the octopus. Along with squid and cuttlefish, this trio of cephalopods is considered to be among the most intelligent invertebrates on Earth. Near urban areas, octopuses have been known to make homes of bottles, jars and even discarded coffee cups. John Turnbull, Author provided In the case of the octopus, this may be due to having nine “brains”, including a donut-shaped brain in the head and a mini brain in each tentacle, which allow the tentacles to operate somewhat independently. Australia has several octopus species, from the gloomy octopus (Octopus tetricus) on the east coast, to the Maori octopus (O. maorum) in the south. The potentially deadly blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena sp.) is found right around Australia. This gloomy octopus made a move for my camera as I took its photo. John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided Octopus forage at night, in shallow waters and to depths exceeding 500 metres. During the day they’ll return to their lair, which may be a hole, a ledge or a crack in a rock. They’ll often decorate their home with the discarded shells of their prey. Read more: This super rare squid is a deep-sea mystery. We recently spotted not 1, but 5, in the Great Australian Bight (Sometimes) stingers You’ve probably seen jellyfish at the beach before, too. Species such as the moon jelly (Aurelia aurita) are harmless. But others can deliver a painful sting; bluebottles (Physalia utriculus) might come to mind here, also called the Pacific man-of-war. Bluebottles and their relatives, blue buttons (P. porpita) and by-the-wind sailors (V. velella) don’t swim. They float at the ocean’s surface and go where the winds blow, which is how they sometimes get washed onto the beach. By-the-wind sailors have an angled ‘sail’ which takes advantage of the wind, moving them large distances to catch prey. John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided Rather than being one animal, they are made of many polyps or “zooids” living together in a floating colony. Each polyp has a specialised role such as flotation, stinging, catching prey, digestion or reproduction. Anemones are also related to jellyfish, and come in many shapes and colours – from the bright red waratah anemone (Actinia tenebrosa) found in all states, to the multi-coloured shellgrit anemone (Oulactis muscosa) found from SA to QLD. They use their tentacles to sting and catch prey, but have no impact on humans. Many anemones live among the rocks and rock pools in the intertidal area, although some species, such as the swimming anemone (Phlyctenactis tuberculosa), live as deep as 40m underwater. Top left: shellgrit anemone, top right: swimming anemone, bottom left: red waratah anemone, bottom right: green snakelock anemone (Aulactinia veratra) John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided Fancy fishes Of course there are many fish to be seen along our shores – more than we could possibly mention here! In the shallows, we particularly like to find big-eyed gobies. Some of the most colourful fish in this zone are young damselfish. These are most diverse in tropical Australia, but still found in temperate waters. Their juvenile forms can be striped and spotted, with colours ranging from bright yellow to iridescent blue. Immaculate damsels are endemic to Australian waters. John Turnbull/Flickr, Author provided It’s best to photograph any fish you want to identify. Resources such as Reef Life Survey and Fishes of Australia can help with this. If you upload your photos to the iNaturalist website, other users can help you ID them too. Uploading is also a big help to scientists, who then have a record of each sighting. Finally, the diversity of marine life on our coast isn’t something we can afford to take for granted. So if you hit the beach this summer, make sure you: do not bring any single-use plastics never leave anything behind (and preferably pick up any litter you see) and keep pets and cars away from sensitive habitats, such as dunes and bird nesting areas.

4,How COVID-19 changed the way we shop – and what to expect in 2022 and beyond,2022-01-03,,"ShutterstockCOVID-19 has dramatically changed how businesses and consumers behave. We’ve seen panic buying, the rise of the “homebody economy” and a strong shift towards contactless shopping. As we emerge from the worst of the pandemic, it seems the right time to reflect on the most important changes in consumer behaviour we’ve seen, and to make some predictions about COVID-19’s lasting and pervasive effects on how we shop. Pandemic purchasing One of the first impacts of COVID-19 was supermarket shelves being repeatedly stripped of toilet paper and other products ahead of lockdowns. One debate this behaviour sparked was about how much it could be considered irrational panic buying – or if it was rational to stockpile in response to the irrational behaviour of others. It was a real-life lesson in game theory. Decisions that make perfect sense for individuals can add up to a bad outcome for the community. Read more: A toilet paper run is like a bank run. The economic fixes are about the same Spending less, spending more Spending more money at the supermarket was at least possible. Consumption patterns changed significantly due to closed borders, restricted shopping, stay-at-home orders and general uncertainty. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows large drops in spending on transport, accommodation, recreation and entertainment services, and catering. Individual services consumption, 2020 Percentage change in household services consumption by select categories per quarter 2020. ABS, Insights into household consumption, December quarter 2020 Spending on food increased marginally, and on alcohol even more. The main reasons cited for increased drinking, according to one study, were stress (45.7%), increased alcohol availability (34.4%) and boredom (30.1%). Individual goods consumption, 2020 Percentage change in household goods consumption by select categories per quarter 2020. ABS, Insights into household consumption, December quarter 2020 Spending also increased on home-related electronics, streaming services, furnishings, hardware and pet-related items. Interest increased in traditional activities such as cooking, reading and gardening. It is too early to tell to what extent these pandemic-driven shifts will translate into permanent behavioural change. However, research published last month, based on surveying 7,500 households in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, supports the likelihood of at least some long-term sectoral shifts in consumer behaviour. Predictions of a shopping splurge As restrictions relax, some marketing experts are predicting “revenge spending” – shopping sprees with abandon. Certainly many higher-income households have the money to splash out on a holiday, or new car, or home renovation, with Australians banking an estimated A$140 billion in extra savings during the pandemic. Other research, such as the National Australia Bank’s quarterly Consumer Sentiment Survey, suggests the pandemic has engendered greater caution. In its most recent survey, 37% said they were mindful or careful of where they spent their money (42% of women and 33% of men). In terms of purchasing influences, 43% nominated supporting local businesses, compared with 15% environmental issues and 14% social concerns such as labour practices. In NAB’s consumer sentiment survey 43% said their purchases were influenced by the desire to support local business. Shutterstock Some have wondered if, in the wake of COVID-19, we are about to experience another “Roaring Twenties” – emulating that period of economic prosperity and cultural dynamism in the 1920s following the deprivations of the first world war and the “Spanish flu” epidemic. The circumstances are not exactly analogous. But new technologies and changes in habits are likely to drive several long-term changes in the way we shop. Going contactless Our desire to reduce physical contact accelerated contactless payment methods. Research (from the Netherlands) suggests this will, for most, be a permanent change, accelerating a steady decline in the use of cash for shopping. ATM cash withdrawals using debit cards Monthly, seasonally adjusted. Reserve Bank of Australia Technology enabling payments using smartphones, such as supermarkets introducing a way to pay by scanning a QR code, will contribute to this shift. Read more: The paradox of going contactless is we're more in love with cash than ever Ways to buy things without ever having to step inside a shop – such as curbside pick-up and home delivery – should also continue. In 2021 we’ve seen a number of startup businesses promising grocery deliveries in 15 minutes. “Omni” experiences Increasingly our buying behaviour will be shaped by what marketing experts call omnichannel shopping – a fancy word meaning using a variety of experiences to make a purchase. You might, for instance, go into a store to try out headphones, then go online to read third-party reviews and compare prices from different retailers. Technologies such as augmented reality will facilitate this trend. For example, IKEA’s Place app allows you to see how furnishing will into your space. IKEA’s ‘Place’ app. IKEA More and more what were once physical experiences will have their digital variants, from attending university to having an appointment with a health professional to taking a tour of the British Museum or exploring the Grand Canyon. Though these cannot replicate the real experience, they will be an increasingly common way to “try before you buy”. The future of shopping will gradually merge the digital and physical. But whatever changes, some things will remain constant: the human desire to make experiences convenient, fun and meaningful. Adrian R.

5,Curious Kids: how exactly does a spaceship get into space?,2022-01-03,,"Shutterstock How exactly does a spaceship get into space? – Mathilde, age 5, Sydney Hello Mathilde, thanks for this great question! It isn’t easy to get to space, and there are a few steps to it. First, let’s think about where “space” itself actually begins. Well, some time ago, a number of experts decided on one point above us as being the point where “space” begins. They marked it with an invisible line called the Kármán line. This line goes all around the Earth and is about 100km above us. To help you understand how high that is, a normal aircraft flies only about 10km above the ground. The Kármán line is very high above us, and wraps all around the Earth. Shutterstock Could we take a plane to space? There are many reasons we can’t just use an aircraft to get into space. A major one is that the higher up we go, the less air there is – or specifically the less “oxygen” there is in the air. The engine is what helps the aircraft fly. And just like car engines, aircraft engines need oxygen to work. Thankfully, the air we breathe is made up of 21% oxygen (although you can’t see it)! Aircraft suck air in at the front, using big fans on either side. They then mix this air with jet fuel, creating a mixture of fuel and oxygen which is then burned, making the air hotter. The hot air is then shot out the back at a very high speed – pushing the aircraft forward. The two large fans on the sides of an aircraft help suck in air, which has oxygen. Shutterstock But an aircraft trying to fly too close to space, where there isn’t enough oxygen, would be like a person trying to breathe in a room with no air in it. This is why we need rockets to get to space. The big difference between rocket engines and jet engines used in aircraft is rocket engines do not need to get oxygen from the air. Instead, they carry their own oxygen with them. In some ways this is bad, since rocket engines have to carry something that an aircraft can easily get from all around it. That means there’s less room on a rocket for other cargo, such as passengers and luggage. But on the bright side, being able to take oxygen along for the journey means rockets can work in space, much higher up than where most aircraft fly. How does a rocket engine work? Similar to an aircraft’s jet engine, rocket engines work by shooting very hot gas out from the back of the rocket. As the gas is pushed backwards, the rocket is pushed forward. This is an example of a rule in science called the Third Law of Motion, first discovered by a famous scientist named Isaac Newton. This law says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. You can even make a very basic “rocket” at home with some help from an adult! If you get a balloon, blow it up, and let it go without tying off the end, the air inside will shoot out and send it flying around the room – just like a very badly controlled rocket!

9,Taylor Swift Songs Often Come to Her in a ‘Cloud’ and She Has to ‘Grab It’,2022-01-03,"How does Taylor Swift write a song? The ""All Too Well"" singer admits that it's a different process for her every time.","Though there are plenty of successful singers, what has always set Taylor Swift apart is her songwriting abilities. The All Too Well artist has spent the last two decades penning songs about in a variety of genres. In fact, Swift has written or co-written every single song that she has released throughout the course of her career. Perhaps what makes Swift such an adept songwriter is her consistency. She started writing tunes long before she made a name for herself in the music industry. Her dream of being a famous singer began in childhood, and it was then that she began putting her thoughts, ideas, and feelings into music. But just how does Swift go about writing songs, and has her process changed throughout the years? Taylor Swift | Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Taylor Swift’s songwriting process is constantly changing Swift has been pretty open with her fans about her songwriting process. And while she has managed to produce numerous hits, her process is ever-changing. Sometimes she hears music that inspires her lyrics, other times the lyrics come first and she had to craft the appropriate music to hold the words. RELATED: Taylor Swift Wrote 12 Songs Before Realizing ‘folklore’ Was an Album Fans of Swift have had the opportunity to glimpse Swift’s musical mind in action. In her documentary, Miss Americana, viewers were astounded when Swift and her collaborator, Jack Antonoff, wrote the bridge to “Getaway Car” in mere seconds. Contrarily, in Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift revealed that she had the lyrics “meet me behind the mall” saved in her phone for years before she found an appropriate spot for them in “august”. Sometimes lyrics and music come to the singer in a cloud In an interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Swift got candid about how varied and wonderous her songwriting process can be. Sometimes an idea comes to her like a wave and all she had to do is bottle it. “There are definitely moments when it’s like this cloud of an idea comes and just lands in front of your face, and you reach up and grab it,” she shared with Pattie Boyd. RELATED: Taylor Swift Revealed Her Album ‘Reputation’ Was ‘Just a Metaphor’ Of course, the songwriting process isn’t always so enchanting. Other times, Swift must rely on discipline and her knowledge of song construction to get the job done. But however songs come to her, Swift has a deep appreciation for the unique process and finds it to be one of the most fulfilling aspects of her career. Swift calls writing songs the purest part of her job “A lot of songwriting is things you learn, structure, and cultivating that skill, and knowing how to craft a song,” Swift shared. “But there are mystical, magical moments, inexplicable moments when an idea that is fully formed just pops into your head. And that’s the purest part of my job. It can get complicated on every other level, but the songwriting is still the same uncomplicated process it was when I was 12 years old writing songs in my room.” RELATED: Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato Aren’t Friends; Is Taylor Swift the Reason?

Ted Roof was named defensive coordinator for the Sooners in December. Bates held the title of assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator with the Tigers. He was promoted to assistant head and recruiting coordinator when Brent Venables left his position as defensive coordinator to become the new Sooners coach. Before his departure, Venables was Clemson's defensive coordinator and assistant head coach. Since Venables left for Oklahoma, Clemson has also lost offensive coordinator Tony Elliot, who left to become the coach at Virginia, and athletic director Dan Radakovich, who left the program for Miami. Clemson coach Dabo Swinney will have his work cut out for him this offseason as he tries to replace several key coaches on his staff.

While she’s proven she’s still a tough competitor, her injury from Cutthroat has haunted her, causing her to quit a couple of daily missions. Every time? Not true. I’ve tried to be cool and face my fear and got hurt…a few times. I’m over it & it’s not worth it to me. Is it time for me to stop doing the shows b/c heights are inevitable?

Therefore, she no longer has an interest in doing them as it’s “not worth it to me.” The Inferno winner went on to admit it’s “obvious” that she should not return because “heights are inevitable.” She clapped back at fans who criticized her for quitting On New Year’s Eve, Cooley responded to a few comments from fans who vocalized their opinions about her refusal to compete in challenges involving heights over water. In a tweet, she wrote, “Let me make something clear for all the f—- who can’t grasp the concept.

Someone replied to her, noting they didn’t mind her reasoning but wondered why she would “take a spot” from another player who would compete. Cooley claimed the producers are “very specific” when it comes to casting. Therefore, she doesn’t believe she’s “stealing” an opportunity. Afterward, The Inferno champ deleted her original tweet, admitting she shouldn’t have responded to the critics in the manner she did.

With 11 goals and two assists in 12 Premier League 2 games, McAtee is showing his quality and immense potential. Pep Guardiola even handed McAtee a Premier League debut earlier this season in a display that prompted Gary Neville to liken him to David Silva. The problem for City is that McAtee is out of contract in 2023 and clubs now want to take advantage and sign him.

24,The Beatles and Rolling Stones Requested Private Screenings of This Psychedelic Monkees Film,2022-01-03,"Both the Beatles and The Rolling Stones reportedly requested private screenings of The Monkees first and only film, 'Head.'","The Beatles and The Rolling Stones reportedly requested private screenings of The Monkees‘ first and only psychedelic film titled Head. Unlike their family-friendly television series, the film played into the psychedelic era of the late 1960s. Head was a stream-of-consciousness concept reportedly created to change The Monkees image. The Monkees | Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images What was The Monkees’ ‘Head’ about? The film was a series of linked vignettes. Head featured Mike Nesmith, Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, and Peter Tork in scenarios unlike the happy, slapstick personas made famous on their television series. Moviegoers were likely not ready to see Dolenz running through a municipal ribbon-cutting ceremony and subsequently jumping off a bridge to the band’s “Porpoise Song.” In Head, the band members broke through thier manufactured television image and was a financial and professional disaster for the band. However, The Guardian claimed the film was not well-received. “The movie dropped like a ball of a dark star. The simile of a rock in the water is too mild for how badly that movie did,” said Peter Tork. The Beatles and Rolling Stones asked for private screenings of ‘Head’ The Beatles and The Rolling Stones | Potter/Express/Keystone/Getty Images According to The Guardian, Monkees producer Bob Rafelson claimed both The Beatles and Rolling Stones reportedly requested private screenings of the movie. The Monkees and Beatles were already friends before Head, directed by Bob Rafelson and written by Jack Nicholson. The Beatles lent a snippet of the song “Good Morning, Good Morning” used in the final episode of The Monkees TV series “The Frodis Caper,” directed and written by Micky Dolenz. As The Monkees filmed Head, the Rolling Stones starred in Jean-Luc Godard’s Sympathy For the Devil. One year earlier, The Beatles starred in the TV film, Magical Mystery Tour. Micky Dolenz said Jack Nicholson wrote ‘Head’ after spending a weekend with The Monkees Micky Dolenz underwater shooting a scene from ‘Head’ | Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images In an interview with Esquire, Rafelson said idea was to make a bunch of different movies and put them together into one package. The result was the destruction of The Monkees’ wholesome made-for-TV image Rafelson and his partner Bert Schneider had co-created. Rafelson considered Head an audacious film, “so audacious that nobody saw the [expletive] thing.” Head has since become a cult classic among Monkees fans. It was conceived after the band members and struggling actor Jack Nicholson spent time together at an Ojai, California resort. “He was such a wonderful, charismatic, funny guy. Jack spent a lot of time with us. He hung out on the set and came out on tour, just picking up the vibe,” Dolenz claimed to The Guardian.

McLaren’s MCL35M would have had some different designs if it had not spent its tokens on adjusting its chassis to fit the Mercedes’ engine. The FIA in its COVID emergency planning had made it compulsory for the teams to use the same chassis designs for both the 2020 and 2021 seasons. This was done keeping in mind that the technical regulations were almost the same between 2020 and 2021. However, the teams were given some development tokens to make minor changes and updates to their car. But, McLaren had to use all the tokens to shift from Renault to Mercedes in 2021. This left them incapable of making any changes to the weak components of their car that they had identified in 2020. The technical director of the Woking-based team, James Key, said, “we didn’t dwell on it too long.” BACK TO THE FUTURE As @McLarenF1 and Mercedes reveal a new power unit partnership from 2021, here’s a reminder of their past successes together in the 90s and 00s #F1 pic.twitter.com/P1twJnatsJ — Formula 1 (@F1) September 28, 2019 “We would have loved to have had the token spend. We always said [it was] a little bit unfortunate that we had to spend it on engine installation. A lot of components had to change, but the intent of homologation was to keep components the same, so you can kind of understand it.” “We brought the bits forward to try and overcome some of those issues, so we did extra work in 2020 to compensate for the fact we didn’t have tokens to spend in ’21,” he further added. Also Read: Honda F1 boss Masashi Yamamoto reveals which Red Bull personality convinced them to stay after McLaren break-up McLaren would have made changes to its front suspension If the team had their normal freedom it surely would have made the changes. Although Key says that not being able to do so did not put the team at a massive disadvantage. Key explained, “I think, with the busyness of a new engine installation probably dominated our thoughts. But, yeah, I think there would have been things we would have done differently.” He believes that the engine installation would have been a bit different. They had to install a Mercedes engine in a car designed for a Renault engine. That’s what the FIA wanted to see. Key explained that in a normal scenario that would not have happened. “You’d put it in a car designed for a Mercedes, so there were a few compromises there. As far as token spend is concerned, there are probably a few areas we would have attacked again around the front suspension.” “Maybe a little bit on the rear mechanically, but I don’t think it put us at a massive disadvantage. The concepts we wanted on the ’21 car, we put on in 2020 in the end,” he concluded.

26,‘Show and tell’ sessions could include engines,2022-01-03,Stefano Domenicali would like 'show and tell' sessions next season to include engines. The post ‘Show and tell’ sessions could include engines appeared first on PlanetF1.,"‘Show and tell’ sessions being introduced next year could include engines if F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali gets his way. In November, F1’s managing director of motorsport, Ross Brawn, unveiled plans for a new Friday morning event on race weekends to be introduced in 2022 that would allow the media and fans a much closer look at the cars and what changes have been made ahead of lights out on Sundays. It was confirmed later that month that teams had agreed to such sessions taking place, which means they will almost certainly be held from the first race weekend of next season onwards. Aspects such as aerodynamic components and anything else new introduced to the chassis of cars is what the focus of such sessions will most likely be on, but Domenicali would like engines to be revealed too. He feels the sport has an excellent product to be proud of in their hybrid power units and that they need to do more to show and market that. “So far, we haven’t done any sensible advertising for our product. We haven’t made it clear who we are and what we stand for. This has to stop,” he said, quoted by Auto Motor und Sport. “We are motorsport and not just a laboratory for technology and research. We have to give people something. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be here. “It’s time to get out of the corner and make sure everyone understands who we are.” Manufacturers will be unable to make any changes to their engines once the 2022 campaign is under way, with a development freeze being implemented and staying in place until new regulations are introduced in 2026. Domenicali understands competitors will be reluctant to give anything away to their rivals before then because of that, but says they will have no reason to hide anything once the freeze is in place. “The engines are frozen for four years,” he added.   “That is why the manufacturers are so keen to keep them under lock and key until then. When it comes to performance, they have to ensure they are taking the right step for the future. “Then the product is ready.” There has been much talk about Volkswagen Group joining the sport once the new engine regulations are confirmed and Domenicali has said an “important month” is ahead in that regard.   The post ‘Show and tell’ sessions could include engines appeared first on PlanetF1.","['News', 'Stefano Domenicali']",https://www.planetf1.com/news/show-tell-sessions-2022-engines/,,planetf1

28,"Report: Bayern Munich, Juventus, Real Madrid, PSG have “opened talks” with Chelsea’s Antonio Rüdiger",2022-01-03,,"Photo by James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images Could the Bavarians be ready to strike on the German defender? According to Sky, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Juventus, and Paris Saint-Germain have “opened talks” with Chelsea FC defender Antonio Rüdiger. Manchester United is also listed in the report as a club that could get involved in the bidding fray as well. Sky says, however, that Rüdiger remains focused on staying with Chelsea: Real Madrid, PSG, Bayern Munich and Juventus have opened talks with Antonio Rüdiger’s representatives over a pre-contract agreement this month. Rüdiger’s Chelsea contract is up in the summer. Chelsea want to extend Rüdiger’s contract. Staying at Chelsea has not been ruled out. Chelsea’s last contract offer in the summer was not considered as it was worth half of what Chelsea’s top earners are on. Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick is a long term admirer of the defender and knows Rüdiger’s brother - and agent - very well. Rüdiger remains 100 percent focused and committed to Chelsea and Thomas Tuchel continues to count on him. Rüdiger has started 20 Premier League games this season – the most of any Chelsea outfield player. Bayern Munich’s interest in Rüdiger would seem to be contingent on the club’s ability to re-sign Niklas Süle, whose status is still in question.",,https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2022/1/3/22865105/bayern-munich-juventus-real-madrid-psg-manchester-united-transfer-chelsea-antonio-rudiger-sule-dfb,,bavarianfootballworks
29,Amanda Serrano offers to fight Valentina Shevchenko if Dana White agrees to Jake Paul’s demands,2022-01-03,,"Multi-division boxing champion Amanda Serrano is ready to sweeten the deal by crossing over to the UFC if Dana White caters to the demands presented to him by Jake Paul. This past week saw Paul and the UFC president engage in a war of words over social media, issuing a series of challenges to the other. Now, Serrano is throwing her name into the mix, offering to face UFC flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko. “I will gladly sign a one-fight deal with the UFC to challenge Valentina for the flyweight Championship if UFC agrees to Jake’s offer,” Serrano wrote on Twitter. “Let’s make history.” I will gladly sign a one fight deal with the UFC to challenge Valentina for the Flyweight Championship if UFC agrees to Jake’s offer. Let’s make history.— Amanda Serrano (@Serranosisters) January 2, 2022 While the chances that Serrano actually gets the fight with Shevchenko are somewhere between slim and none, the tweet is just the latest in a long series of exchanges where White and Paul have traded blows on Twitter, Instagram and through a series of videos. After Paul had challenged several UFC fighters to crossover to boxing, White shot down that request and then offered to undergo cocaine testing for the next decade if the former social influencer turned boxer agreed to two years of testing for steroids. Paul then fired back with a counter offer of his own with numerous conditions, including a new minimum salary for UFC fighters as well as increase the overall revenue paid to the athletes along with long-term healthcare benefits. In exchange, Paul said he would retire from boxing immediately and ink a one-fight deal with the UFC to face Jorge Masvidal in an MMA contest. The 24-year-old undefeated boxer laughed off White’s claim that he was doing steroids as he continued to escalate his demands regarding better treatment for UFC fighters. Of course, Serrano counts Paul and his Most Valuable Promotions as her current promoter. She inked a deal to join his company after she served as the co-main event on his first fight against ex-UFC champion Tyron Woodley earlier this year. Serrano has praised Paul for raising her profile in the sport of boxing, offering her better financial opportunities as well as high-profile slots on the two most recent cards he’s fought. While there’s no chance White will actually concede to any of Paul’s demands, Serrano actually has past MMA experience with a 2-0-1 record including a submission win this past June under the IKON Fighting Federation banner.",,https://www.mmafighting.com/2022/1/3/22865315/amanda-serrano-offers-to-fight-valentina-shevchenko-if-dana-white-agrees-to-jake-pauls-demands,,mmafighting
30,Fighter barred from Czech MMA organization due to Hitler tattoo,2022-01-03,,"Radek Roušal was found to have a portrait of Adolf Hitler on his arm. A Czech fighter has been removed from a scheduled bout at a tournament last week for sporting neo-Nazi tattoos. Radek Roušal was expected to face Slovak fighter Nikolas Krivák in an Oktagon MMA event in Brno, Czech Republic, but was barred from competition after it was revealed that the fighter had a portrait of Adolf Hitler emblazoned on his arm. A second tattoo on his chest revealed a skull wearing an SS cap, a reference to the SS Totenkopfverbände unit responsible for administering the Nazi death camps. Speaking with Czech outlet iDNES.cz, Oktagon MMA promoter Ondřej Novotný noted his disgust with the situation, adding that the outcry from MMA fans is “justified.” “It cannot happen that you would come here looking like that,” Oktagon MMA promoter Ondřej Novotný told iDNES.cz. “We have a clause about that in the contract, we could fine him. For the tattoo on his chest as well. No way! It’s absolutely justified that there’s an outcry. We didn’t study what he looks like, neither did our photographers or our cameramen noticed the tattoo. Nobody spoke of it beforehand. We did not know about it, certainly not.” Roušal later claimed that the tattoos were the remnants of his “troubled” past and that he regrets his actions. “I grew up in the troubled community of people that made this tattoo,” Roušal told Extra.cz. “At the time, I didn’t know what to do with life, I was young and this tattoo was stupid. Later, I started doing martial arts, which led me to a completely different life and worldview. I have more tattoos that I regret, I gradually remove them all. I also want to apologize with my statement.” Muay Thai Brno, the gym where Roušal trains for competition, has also come to the fighter’s aid on social media, alleging that Roušal planned to remove the tattoos in January 2022. “Radek and I have dealt with the situation, and according to him, he has been ordering a deadline for January for the removal of tattoos, which, according to him, was created years ago in youthful recklessness. However, the offer for the match came at the last minute, before it was removed. “Our gym is clearly against any manifestations of any racial or other discrimination or intolerance. People of all nationalities and skin colors meet here, we cooperate with various non-profit organizations, including those that work with minorities. At the same time, we also lend a helping hand to those who can learn from their mistakes and mistakes.”",,https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2022/1/3/22865327/fighter-neo-nazi-adolf-hitler-tattoo-czech-republic-oktagon-mma-crime-news,,bloodyelbow

The Sky pundit agreed that even though Antonio Conte ‘doesn’t fancy’ the Tottenham players, they won’t leave unless ‘they get their drink out of it’. Half-Season Team of the Season & Awards | HITC Sevens Christmas SpecialBridTV7493Half-Season Team of the Season & Awards | HITC Sevens Christmas Special930141930141center13872 From the above players named, only Ndombele has started a Premier League game under Conte and that was Tottenham’s 2-2 draw with Liverpool. The signs do suggest that if another team were to knock on their doors for those players, then there wouldn’t be much fight to keep them. And their lack of minutes out on the pitch also suggests that they should be looking to move on. But Merson doesn’t think they will be going anywhere anytime soon, as he suggested that the financial situation has to suit them for that to happen. “There are assets they could sell,” said presenter Jeff Stelling. “Maybe Steven Bergjwin. Joe Rodon, who he doesn’t seem to fancy. Ndombele, who he doesn’t seem to fancy. Lo Celso.” Merson responded: “The problem is, in this day and age. All them players, you have just named. They aren’t going anywhere. “Unless they get their drink out of it. They aren’t going to go anywhere and that’s going to be the problem. “If you are going to get rid of them, then they are going to have to swallow a pill.” Photo by Tottenham Hotspur FC/Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty Images Tottenham are chasing Champions League football under Conte and their outgoings might just be as important as their incomings. For far too long now, Spurs have been in a situation where a number of their star players or big-money players have either stagnated or they just haven’t worked. The likes of Ndombele are certainly in that bracket and a move away from north London is the best option. But given the club-record fee that was paid for the Frenchman, it’s not going to be that easy parting ways with him.

33,Tuchel nets huge boost as star extends Chelsea stay to ease defensive issues,2022-01-03,The Blues have work to do on a number of contracts but one is safely done and dusted. The post Tuchel nets huge boost as star extends Chelsea stay to ease defensive issues appeared first on TEAMtalk.,"Thomas Tuchel has received a fillip after defender Thiago Silva extended his Chelsea contract for another year until the end of the 2022-2023 season. Silva, 37, moved to Stamford Bridge from Paris Saint-Germain in August 2020 after spending eight years at the Parc des Princes. The Brazil international penned a one-year deal with an option for a further 12 months. That was duly taken last summer after the former AC Milan ace made 23 Premier League starts for the Blues. He has played a full part this term, with 14 starts among 17 top-flight outings. And he has been seen 22 times in all competitions, scoring twice. Despite the South American’s age, Chelsea have wasted no time in extending his contract for another 12 months. Silva was delighted with the deal after being linked with a move away. And he is determined to keep battling for the west Londoners in the twilight years of his career. “To play here with Chelsea is a real pleasure. I never thought I would play for three years here in this great club, so I’m very happy to stay for another season,” he told the Chelsea website. “I will continue to give everything for this club and for the supporters, who have always been by my side since I arrived. “It’s amazing to have this relationship with the fans and not only that but the players, staff and the whole club. “I am going to give everything to keep playing at this level in the most important league in the world.” Silva offers Tuchel timely boost There are several contract issues involving the Chelsea rearguard. Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen will be out of contract in the summer and reports claim talks are going nowhere. The European champions want the duo to stay but are unable to offer them what they want. Sky Sports say Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Juventus have opened talks over a pre-contract agreement with Rudiger. Tottenham have been linked in the past and remain keen. Cesar Azpilicueta will also be a free agent at the end of the campaign. He wants a longer deal than Chelsea are prepared to offer and may be on his way. Therefore securing Silva for another season was essential and director Marina Granovskaia outlined what he means to the side. “Thiago Silva’s experience, leadership and performances have been and remain very important to this squad. So we are hugely pleased to extend his contract by another year,” she said. “We look forward to his continued influence as we seek honours this season and next, and more of the qualities that have led to him having such a big impact for us on and off the pitch.” READ MORE: Chelsea insider reveals damning fallout from Lukaku comments, including four key players’ views The post Tuchel nets huge boost as star extends Chelsea stay to ease defensive issues appeared first on TEAMtalk.","['English Premier League', 'All The News', 'Promos', 'Front Page', 'Chelsea', 'Homepage', 'Thiago Silva']",https://www.teamtalk.com/chelsea/tuchel-nets-huge-boost-thiago-silva-extends-chelsea-stay-ease-defensive-issues,,teamtalk

Viewers have known for a while that Kurt Caldwell is targeting runaways passing through Iron Lake. The series also slowly revealed why Kurt has such a specific M.O. However it wasn’t until episode 9 that Dexter fans saw what Kurt does with the bodies of his victims. Clancy Brown as Kurt in ‘Dexter: New Blood’ | Seacia Pavao/Showtime Kurt Caldwell is a serial killer in ‘Dexter: New Blood’ Kurt Caldwell is a serial killer preying on young runaway women passing through Iron Lake. He gains the trust of these women by offering them food or money and later imprisons them in his isolated cabin. After a while, he opens the doors to the cabin, and while the imprisoned woman tries to run, he shoots her in the back. Dexter: New Blood Episode 7 reveals that Kurt’s first victim was Angela’s old friend Iris. Kurt picked up a runaway Iris to give her a ride. However, a scuffle ensued when Kurt tried to drive her home. Iris bit Kurt and jumped out of the truck. Kurt shot her in the back as she ran away, beginning a kill cycle that he repeated with all of his victims. How long's it been since Kurt has seen the light? by @SBookstaver pic.twitter.com/2zC7F0dqVH— Dexter on Showtime (@SHO_Dexter) December 16, 2021 What does Kurt do with the bodies of his victims? Previous episodes of Dexter: New Blood hinted that keeping the faces of his victims intact is very important to Kurt. Episode 9 explained why. Harrison and Dexter find Kurt’s “trophy room” with the help of Harrison’s drone. Unlike Dexter’s blood slides, Kurt keeps very large trophies. He preserves the bodies of his victims, dresses them all in white, and lines them up on display in an underground room. Notably, Chloe is not present amongst his victims, as she was shot in the eye when Kurt killed her. This finally explains the clip shown of someone cleaning the bodies and draining them of blood. I had the same violent urges when I was your age. But my dad taught me a code, a way to channel those urges. pic.twitter.com/3G233ElDKR— Dexter on Showtime (@SHO_Dexter) December 31, 2021 When Kurt was on Dexter’s kill table, he also explained his twisted justification for murdering these women. “I saved them,” Kurt said. “They’re just runaways. Do you have any idea the trauma that they were gonna go through? I do. I saw it — I saw it first hand, what my dad would do to them.” Kurt’s father was a trucker who picked up sex workers and abused them. A very young Kurt witnessed the abuse. “I’d pick them up on the road and I’d take them to my cabin and I’d give them a nice room and a warm meal and safety, but that was never enough for them,” Kurt continued. “They always wanted to go back out there, and so I preserved them, kept them safe forever.” Is Kurt Caldwell dead? Needless to say Dexter didn’t buy Kurt’s excuses for murdering innocent women. Dexter tells Kurt that his murders were really about power, not saving anyone. Dexter kills Kurt and he and Harrison dispose of his body in the town incinerator. Although Kurt is out of the picture, Dexter isn’t out of the woods. Angela is getting closer and closer to the truth. In Dexter: New Blood Episode 9, someone (presumably Kurt) left her a note that reads, “Jim Lindsay killed Matt Caldwell,” along with one of the titanium screws from Matt’s leg. Will Angela be the one to take down Dexter?

The League One duo have been heavily linked with a move that would see them reunited with former boss Russell Martin. It had even been reported that an agreement had already been agreed to sign ‘keeper Fisher for the South Wales side. However, a local journalist has insisted no official bid has been made yet. Sports Editor of the MK Citizen Toby Lock tweeted: “As it stands though (Monday 3/1 in case this ages badly!) I understand there haven’t been any bids for either player for any club.” While discussions could be ongoing ‘unofficially’, it seems unlikely a deal will be completed this week. It had previously been reported that O’Riley could become a Swans player as soon as Wednesday. However with no offer on the table, this no longer seems to be the case. Fisher is believed to be targeted by both Swansea and Huddersfield Town, with Swans at an advantage given Martin’s link to the club. Both players have been key figures for the Dons this season, missing just three league games between them. And while MK Dons will be in no rush to lose the influential duo, manager Liam Manning will be conscious his side have enough time to find replacements if a deal was to go through. Wayne Rooney emerging as Everton replacement for under-pressure Rafael Benitez Manager insists he doesn’t want further delays to games Martin is hopeful his FA Cup tie against Southampton can go ahead, despite COVID cases within his camp. Swansea have seen their last four games postponed, and are now without a game since 11th December. And Martin insisted while his squad is tight, he still wants the match-up against Premier League opposition to go ahead. He told BBC Sport: “Hopefully we are over the worst of it. “The last time I spoke [just before Christmas] we had just a couple of cases, but that rose a lot in the few days after that. “We had to shut the training ground down for five days because of the outbreak, on governmental advice. “We then came back in just after Christmas and the guys have trained three days since then.

41,‘Sister Wives’: Kody Brown Says his Family Has Thrown Their Religious Views ‘Out the Window’,2022-01-03,"'Sister Wives' star, Kody Brown thinks that his family no longer value's their religious views.","The Browns have moved across the country to continue living their faith through practicing plural marriage. However, on the Jan 2nd episode of Sister Wives, Kody Brown revealed that the family has thrown their religious views’ out the window.’ What does Kody mean by that? Christine Brown, Janelle Brown, Kody Brown, Robyn Brown, and Meri Brown’ Sister Wives’ | TLC What religion does the Brown family practice? According to InTouch, the Brown family belongs to the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB). The AUB is a sect of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS), which is essentially Mormon faith that allows and encourages polygamy. This sect regards the Book of Mormon and the Bible as sacred scripture. The AUB believes that plural marriage is a crucial step to obtain the highest glory of heaven. Kody Brown and his four wives, Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, Christine Brown, and Robyn Brown have lived this lifestyle their whole lives. Kody, Meri, Christine, and Robyn were all raised in polygamist families. Janelle was the only one of Kodu’s wives to be raised in a monogamous family. However, just months before Janelle and Kody married, her mother entered into a polygamous marriage with Kody’s father. Kody says his family has thrown their religious views ‘out the window’ During the Jan 2nd episode, Kody is discussing the coronavirus (COVID-19) protocol with Janelle. He insists Janelle should kick out their older sons, Garrison and Gabe, from the house if they cannot adhere to his rules. Janelle suggests an alternative. She says, “Gabriel’s not obviously gonna stop seeing his girlfriend.” She asks Kody, “What do you think of Gabriel’s girlfriend moving in for a couple of weeks?” He tells the cameras, “I’m not answering that question. If I answer the negative, then I’m restrictions them from being around each other. If I answer the positive, then I am contradicting my religious views.” He admits, “And you know what, the whole freaking family is just thrown those out the window.” Many of the Brown children have left the faith Many Brown children have already put significant distance between themselves and the Brown family. After pursuing membership for seven years, Janelle’s son, Garrison Brown, left the AUB and joined the mainstream LDS church. Janelle’s eldest daughter, Maddison ‘Maddie’ Brown, was initially pursuing becoming an LDS member but was denied due to the church not wanting a connection with a polygamous family. Instead, she now identifies as an evangelical Christian, like her husband. Meri’s daughter, Mariah Brown, made waves when she came out as a lesbian on Sister Wives. Despite same-sex marriage not being allowed in their faith, the Brown family accepted Mariah fully. Meanwhile, Logan Brown, Kody and Janelle’s eldest son, has left the Mormon church with no interest in polygamy. While Mykelti Brown is married in the LDS faith, she doesn’t plan to have a plural marriage in the future. Also, the same goes for Aspyn Brown. While still a member of the AUB, she and her husband also decided that plural marriage isn’t for them. So far, none of the Brown children have decided to pursue plural marriages. Could this be what Kody was talking about on Sister Wives, regarding his family throwing out their faith? RELATED: ‘Sister Wives’: What Does Kody Brown Mean By’ Full Marriage’?

The release was issued by the group of nuclear-armed countries on Monday, with the signees saying they “affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” They also stressed that nuclear armaments “should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war” rather than be used to start such a conflict. The declaration was praised by Russia’s Foreign Ministry, which said it was an important development for international security.

Moscow was the main driver behind the statement, Zakharova revealed, adding that it was originally designed to be unveiled during the 10th conference on non-proliferation. The meeting was set to kick off in New York on Tuesday, but it has been postponed due to the coronavirus situation in the United States. The rare demonstration of unity shown by the nuclear powers is very important amid the deteriorating international security situation, Zakharova noted, expressing hopes that the statement will contribute to global stability. “We hope that in the current complicated international security environment, the approval of such a political statement by the leaders of the nuclear powers will help to reduce the level of international tension and curb the arms race,” she said.",,https://www.rt.com/russia/545070-nuclear-arms-war-statement/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,,rt

44,Prosecutor: Abused baby died of traumatic brain injury,2022-01-03,"On Dec. 22, police responded to a 911 call for a domestic violence incident. When they arrived they found 5-month-old Casey Sams unresponsive and discovered a 2-year-old child who was severely malnourished with evidence of abuse, Deters said.","Two 19-year-old parents were indicted on murder and child abuse charges on Monday in connection with the Dec. 27 death of their 5-month-old baby. Shakayla Sams and Donte Farrier face two counts of murder, three counts of child endangering and three counts of felonious assault in the death of Casey Sams and the alleged abuse of another child in their care, according to Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters. On Dec. 22, police responded to a 911 call for a domestic violence incident at an apartment in South Cumminsville. When they arrived, they found Casey unresponsive and discovered a 2-year-old child who was severely malnourished with evidence of abuse, Deters said. Both children were taken to the hospital; Casey died on Dec. 27 and the 2-year-old remains hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit. The Hamilton County coroner's office determined the cause of Casey's death to be a traumatic brain injury. ""It was also determined that Casey had suffered a dislocated neck, subdural hemorrhage and a swollen brain,"" reads a press release from Deters. ""Doctors found additional evidence of abuse, including old and new rib fractures, bruising on top of his scalp and scarring on his leg."" The 2-year-old was malnourished and showed evidence of recent injuries, previous injuries that had healed and had a lacerated pancreas. If convicted of all charges against them, Sams and Farrier face maximum sentences of life in prison. ""This was not a case of neglect by parents too young to understand their responsibilities,"" said Deters in a press release. ""This was a case of active violence perpetrated on babies by two people, the same people who should be protecting them.""Deters said he has charged the parents with the most severe charges his office believes it can prove, but the investigation is ongoing and there could be additional charges in the future.",,https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/cincinnati/prosecutor-abused-baby-died-of-traumatic-brain-injury,,wcpo

49,Joan Laporta comments on Erling Haaland to Barcelona rumors,2022-01-03,,"Photo by Pedro Salado/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images “Everything is possible” FC Barcelona President Joan Laporta has spoken out on the rumored transfer of Erling Haaland to Barça. While refusing to mention him by name, Laporta left the door open to the signing that is rumored to be his dream. “You will allow me not to talk about players because it does not benefit us, the only thing it does is increase their value. We are working to strengthen ourselves and we are working on it,” he said. His message was clear: the team needs to make sales to afford Haaland, but that is something they are actively working on. “The technical secretary does not cease in his effort to build a great team. It is our responsibility. Everything is possible if it is done well, and if it is done well, I am sure it will turn out very well. “We are aware of the market, we continue to be a benchmark in the market and recovering the weight in world football and all the great players contemplate the possibility of coming to Barça,” he said. “Everyone should get ready because we have returned to the market, and we hope to do well in it. We are working on it every day, to help Barça regain the weight that it must have. And for me, the signing of Ferran Torres is proof. He shows that Barça is still a benchmark. The resurgence is a reality, and the market has noticed.”",,https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2022/1/3/22865080/joan-laporta-comments-on-erling-haaland-to-barcelona-rumors,,barcablaugranes

Amy Slaton recently announced that she and her husband, Michael Halterman, are expecting a new baby. This will be the second pregnancy that TLC fans have gotten to watch Amy go through as she and Halterman had their first child, Gage, in season 2. Amy Slaton and Mike Halterman of ‘1000-lb Sisters’ | TLC/YouTube Amy Slaton announces her pregnancy Fans have been wondering if Amy and Michael were planning on having another baby. Due to a few comments that she has made in season 3 of the show, it seemed like she and her husband had been trying to get pregnant again. Yesterday, Amy took to Instagram to announce the news. “Gage is going to be a big brother in July 2022,” she wrote under a picture of Gage on Instagram. “I’m due July 18th!!!! We are over the moon!!!!” In the photo, Gage dons a shirt that says “I’m going to be a big brother 2022.” Fan reactions Overall, fans were excited for Amy and Michael. “Congrats Amy that’s wonderful you are able to have another,” one fan commented on Instagram. “You can tell how much you love being a mum. “Amy you were meant to be a mom,” another person wrote. “God bless you and your family.” “Wonderful! Little Gage is going to have a brother,” one fan added. “You are so adorable. Congratulations mommy and daddy.” Other fans were worried about Amy’s parenting. “Well, I don’t think we’re surprised,” one person wrote on Reddit. “But I just watched this week’s episode and there was one scene with Gage that left me horrified. It was a legit safety issue. So, I hope she takes some parenting classes in between now and when she gives birth. And weren’t lots of people on here saying Amy was trying for a second baby? “Good Gawd I sure hope her new place is a lot more sanitary but even if it is it won’t stay that way very long, if you’re gross, you’re gross,” another person wrote. “Feel so bad for Gage living in that absolute squalor.” And some fans worried what another pregnancy would do to Amy’s weight loss journey. “I mean, her entire reason for wanting to lose any weight was to have babies,” one fan said. “Now that she’s able to, she doesn’t and isn’t going to care about continuing to drop.” Is Tammy jealous of Amy Slaton? Since Tammy Slaton started her weight loss journey with Amy some fans have wondered if she’s been jealous of how her sister’s life has progressed. Amy was able to get weight loss surgery and got pregnant while Tammy has been struggling to lose enough weight to get surgery. But Tammy addressed those jealousy rumors as soon as they started popping up. “Why do y’all think that I’m jealous of Amy?” Tammy asked in a video. “Why? Why? There’s nothing to be jealous of. She’s married, she lost weight. Big flipping deal. I’m going to get my surgery. I’m going to lose weight in my time. I’m going to get married in my time. I’m going to have children…never, but it’d be in my time. Nobody’s the same. I’m just a little slower than Amy, so what? I am not jealous of her. I am proud of her. I love her. She got what she wanted. I will eventually. Stop saying I’m jealous of somebody that I’m not.” RELATED: ‘1000-Lb Sisters’: Does Tammy Slaton Already Have a New Boyfriend?

After 300 phone calls to researchers across the country, Dr. Steven Gray at the University of Texas Southwestern agreed to help.Gray has a plan for a clinical trial that could potentially cure Maxwell and other children like him.""What we're doing is taking the DNA those patients are missing, packaging it into a harmless virus, and then using that virus as a kind of molecular delivery truck to carry those genes back into their body, fix their DNA, and then hopefully treat their disease,"" Gray said.Because the disease is so rare, government funding is out of reach, leaving the Freed family to raise $4 million on their own to make the clinical trial happen. The deadline to get the money was Friday, and they are still short hundreds of thousands of dollars.""If we don't have the funding, we will lose our cue, and the whole project could be pushed back a year or two years,"" Amber Freed said.That's time that Amber Freed says her son doesn't have.

(credit: ESA - S. Corvaja) Nine days after the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA says it has made good progress deploying the $10 billion instrument and has now begun the critical process of ""tensioning"" the sunshield. On Monday, six motors on board the telescope began the process of fully extending the first of five layers of the sunshield. These tennis-court sized layers, each made of a polyimide film called Kapton, will shade the instrument and allow it to cool down to 50 Kelvin, which is -223 degrees Celsius and just 50 degrees above absolute zero. This cold environment is critical for Webb to observe infrared light and detect heat from very distant objects. NASA's Webb project manager, Bill Ochs, said the first of these five layers should be completely deployed by the end of Monday. The goal is to extend the other four layers on Tuesday and Wednesday. After this time, the massive sunshield—the most complex aspect of an intricate deployment process—will be complete.Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments",['Science'],https://arstechnica.com/?p=1823147,,arstechnica

The veteran Brazilian, 37, was due to become a free agent at the end of the 2021/22 season but has now committed his future to one more year at Stamford Bridge. Silva has been a superb aquisition for Chelsea@CHELSEAFC Silva has contributed to a Champions League title and UEFA Super Cup success in his 18-month stay at in west London. The Brazilian left Paris Saint-Germain as a proven winner in 2020, having been a key member of the side that amassed an incredible 23 trophies during his eight years there. “To play here with Chelsea is a real pleasure. I never thought I would play for three years here in this great club, so I’m very happy to stay for another season,” Silva said in an interview with Chelsea’s club media. “I will continue to give everything for this club and for the supporters, who have always been by my side since I arrived.” Rudiger could leave Chelsea this summer and a host of big names are interested The news of his new deal will be bitter sweet for Tuchel, however, as there has been no progress over a new deal for Antonio Rudiger. Sky Sports claim the Chelsea defender has opened talks with Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Juventus over a pre-contract agreement this month. Chelsea are eager to extend his terms and the German could yet stay put at Stamford Bridge. The report adds that Manchester United remain keen admirers as well with interim manager Ralf Rangnick knowing Rudiger’s brother and agent well. The 28-year-old has been instrumental for Chelsea ever since Tuchel took charge, playing a crucial role in the two trophy triumphs under his compatriot. However, he wants to become one of the highest paid players at Stamford Bridge and the Blues hierarchy are so far unwilling to match his demands.

60,‘The Matrix Resurrections’ Fan Theory Explains Why the Analyst Is Actually the Archivist,2022-01-03,'The Matrix Resurrections' introduces Neil Patrick Harris as The Analyst. One intriguing fan theory suggests that he isn't quite who he says he is.,"The Matrix Resurrections continues to build on the mythology of the original trilogy. Fans around the world are putting together various theories to make sense of where filmmaker Lana Wachowski took this iconic sci-fi universe. One intriguing fan theory about The Matrix Resurrections suggests that The Analyst is actually The Archivist, which explains his abilities and motivations. [Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers from The Matrix Resurrections.] Who is The Analyst in ‘The Matrix Resurrections’? Neil Patrick Harris as The Analyst | Warner Bros. Pictures The Matrix Resurrections takes place years after The Matrix Revolutions. Neo (Keanu Reeves) now lives a seemingly normal life and goes by the name Thomas A. Anderson. He’s the world’s most famous game designer who is instantly drawn to a woman named Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss) but doesn’t recognize her as Trinity. Thomas sees The Analyst (Neil Patrick Harris) to help contain his “hallucinations” and “delusions.” He provides him with blue pills to help. The Analyst is later revealed as the film’s antagonist and has a strong understanding of human psychology. He usurped The Architect and uses his power to control humans within the Matrix. Neil Patrick Harris’ The Analyst is actually The Archivist One thing I did love in the new Matrix was The Analyst (The new Architect) understands the power of human emotion. IMO, Evolved AI would understand that desire and fear are root access to controlling humans–He quips:""The worse we treat you, the more energy"" we get. pic.twitter.com/XbA58WkUd6— Jim OShaughnessy (@jposhaughnessy) December 25, 2021 One Redditor shared a fan theory of The Matrix Resurrections that The Analyst isn’t quite who he says he is. The post suggests that the sequel doesn’t show the real Matrix at all, but is “a museum of the Matrix.” The Redditor shares several reasons to support this theory. The Matrix Resurrections explains that The Analyst doesn’t use agents, but Neo is working on a modal to upskill these agents. This would also explain why the modal frequently shows footage from the first movie, similar to a museum exhibition. The Redditor suggests that the humans in this Matrix aren’t real humans, but activatable swarms that The Analyst takes advantage of in The Matrix Resurrection‘s climax. Neo escaping the Matrix doesn’t bother The Analyst because it’s essentially a replay of the original film. It’s a giant loop that continues to repeat Neo’s story of freeing his mind. Even when Neo believes that he’s won, it’s all a part of The Analyst’s grand design. The Matrix Resurrections repeats “bullet time” and shows The Analyst himself activate it. The Redditor points to its similarity to a looped recording, allowing the antagonist to manipulate time. The program’s limitations hold Neo in check and don’t allow him to die or push beyond barriers. ‘The Matrix Resurrections’ budget and box office The Matrix Resurrections takes full advantage of its special effects, even though it has less action than its predecessors. Collider reported that The Matrix Resurrections cost around $190 million to make. However, it only earned $100 million at the worldwide box office. That’s quite a gap that the movie still must overcome. However, all hope isn’t lost. The Matrix Resurrections still has yet to hit China, which is certain to give the movie a boost. However, the movie is also seeing success in its day-and-date release on the streaming platform HBO Max. The Matrix Resurrections is now playing in theaters and on HBO Max.

62,"The New Day: Big E, King Xavier and Kofi Kingston would love to be WWE villains after years as fan favourites",2022-01-03,Could it be a 'Boo Day'?,"They would love to get another run as bad guys (Picture: WWE) WWE superstars The New Day would love to embrace their villainous side after years as fan favourites. Big E, King Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston have had a fascinating journey as a trio, going from flopping as a babyface group and turning to the dark side before getting cheered and becoming one of the most beloved acts in the company’s storied history. Despite being one of the most popular and successful teams of all time, the three stars have all given plenty of thought to a heel turn, and it’s a side they’d all love to embrace in the future. Speaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk, Xavier laughed: ‘Yeah! One hundred percent – I’m a horrible person! ‘It’s just super fun to scream at little kids, ’cause when we were heels before, our stuff would see kids getting legitimately mad and upset at us. It’s just so much fun to be snarky, to be rude and disliked. ‘It’s great being cheered, and people pulling for us and being the good guys – both sides are really fun to play, but I wouldn’t be mad at it at all. We love that, we talk about it all the time!’ It’s a sentiment echoed by Big E – who lost the WWE Championship at Day 1 after eventual winner Brock Lesnar was added to the main event – as he admitted it’s ‘so much fun’ to be the antagonist. ‘Honestly, we have [wanted that[ the entire time – we’ve always wanted to turn heel. It’s just so much fun,’ he said, although he did point to the benefits of being a fan favourite. ‘What I’m doing in the ring dovetails so well into all the things i wanna do outside of the ring, as far as just charitable work, just telling my story with my issues with depression and mental health. I just don’t think it makes a lot of sense right now.’ Their antics have delighted fans for years (Picture: WWE) That’s not to say it can’t happen in the future, as Big E admitted their previous turns ‘happened organically’, which leaves the door open if the stars ever align. ‘The beautiful thing is our turns kind of happened organically, in the sense that we tried to be babyfaces right out of the gate, people were not having that so we became heels, and then we just got cheered for so long, so eventually we had to turn,’ he laughed. ‘My feeling is, if we do turn, it feels organic and it feels natural again. Unfortunately, we’re in a position right now where our reactions are pretty damn good. So, I don’t see that happening any time soon, but who knows?’ Their comments come after Kofi told us later summer how they would often ‘fantasise’ about the idea of a character shift.

READ MORE: Loops, I did it again – why 2021 was the year of the time loop story The game’s standard edition is up for grabs now, free to anyone who signs up for GOG’s email newsletter. The offer is also open to people who already receive the newsletter. Developed by Russian studio Unfrozen and published by Daedalic Entertainment, the game casts players as the eponymous Iratus, a necromancer “recently freed from his millennia-long imprisonment”, who controls “an obedient army of the living dead”. The game uses a turn-based, tactical battle system as Iratus wages his war on the living. The game features 19 varieties of monstrous servants to control, including skeletons, zombies, vampires, banshees and more, with forces bolstered in appropriately ghoulish fashion by repurposing the body parts of downed enemies. Iratus: Lord of the Dead also features roguelike elements – minions that die are gone for good, forcing deeper consideration of each action – and some nods to similarly devilish titles such as Dungeon Keeper, with an underground lair that can be expanded as players progress. The game’s Wrath of the Necromancer DLC is currently available with a 50 per cent discount. The expansion adds two new minion types, new skins for existing minions, new enemies and bosses, and an expanded alchemy system, allowing players to craft potions to use in battle. It also adds a brand new ending to the story, expanding on the finale of the base game. Iratus: Lord of the Dead will be free to claim until 2pm GMT on Wednesday, January 5. In other news, beloved Final Fantasy 9 character Vivi Ornitier will be appearing in the upcoming kart racing spin-off Chocobo GP, while online shooter Escape From Tarkov has been suffering from sustained server errors that may be down to DDoS attacks.

65,Thrive Market is an online grocery store that sells organic foods at wholesale prices — I saved $100 the first time I used it,2022-01-03,"Thrive Market sells organic food at 25%-50% cheaper than other stores. It's great for snacks, healthy-but-fast foods, and kitchen basics.","Prices are accurate at the time of publication.When you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more.Thrive Market/Facebook Thrive Market curates the best organic, non-GMO groceries, beauty, and cleaning supplies. Prices are 25% to 50% off regular retail, but you pay a membership fee ($60/year or $10/month). I saved over $100 on my first Thrive Market order compared to shopping at a regular grocery store. Thrive Market Membership (Monthly)$9.94 FROM THRIVE MARKETThrive Market Membership (Annual)$60.00 FROM THRIVE MARKETWhen I first tried Thrive Market, I was just coming out of essentially a reverse-cleanse: a 12-pack of macaroni and cheese that I bought at a ""great deal"" discount on Amazon groceries. After a couple of months of eating that and an unrelated health scare, I was ready to commit to a complete pantry overhaul. That's when I started shopping at Thrive Market.What is Thrive Market?Thrive Market bills itself as ""wholesome food at wholesale prices."" It's an online wholesale grocery store that curates the best organic, non-GMO products at a discounted rate of 25% to 50% off retail prices to its members. You have two membership options. The annual membership costs $59.95 (or $5/month), billed once yearly. If you opt to do a monthly membership instead, you'll pay $9.95 per month. You'll get free shipping on your first order over $25, plus all orders $49 or more. Thrive Market currently ships to all contiguous US states.How it works:Sign up for free: You can browse the catalog, see member savings, and receive 25% off your first purchase.Start a free 30-day trial: You can start a free 30-day membership trial with your first purchase on Thrive Market. Cancel anytime.Join as a member: After your trial, you can sign up for a paid membership. If you do, you're also sponsoring a free membership for a low-income family. You can shop Thrive Market by category, by values (e.g., gluten-free, paleo, raw, vegan, etc.), or by current deals. What can you buy at Thrive Market?Thrive Market carries over 6,000 products, and you can shop hundreds of categories. You'll find food, beauty, bath and body, health, babies and kids, home, pet supplies, and other items from brands like Burt's Bees, Acure, Annie's, Seventh Generation, KIND, Bragg, Califa, Milkadamia, and Primal Kitchen.While you can buy staples like meats and seafood, the rest of Thrive Market's selection is mostly shelf-stable options. For produce, you'll probably still want to stop at your neighborhood store, farmers' market, or another grocery delivery option.In addition to offering thousands of organic brands you could find at your local grocery store and online, they also have an in-house Thrive Market brand that packages organic products (the equivalent of your supermarket chain's generic brand).Thrive Market's $60/year or $10/month membership gets you access to savings on healthy foods.Thrive Market/FacebookIf you spend a lot of time researching healthy foods, have a dedicated diet or food restrictions, or consistently buy organic or non-GMO foods online, you'll likely get the most value with Thrive Market. Quality is a concern with organic substitutes, and it's helpful to have customer ratings to simplify things as you go on Thrive Market. The healthy eating community is an intense one, so it's nice that Thrive Market makes use of all that helpful, accumulative passion in a way that I, a newcomer, can utilize too.The 25% to 50% price difference could help close the gap between the sometimes inflated ""organic"" prices at some grocery stores, making Thrive Market a viable choice for the average person on a budget. If ordering food online seems risky to you, it's good to note that you'll be protected by a return policy. If anything is wrong with your groceries or your order, though, let them know here within 21 days.When we price-checked some of the items, Thrive Market was not always cheaper, but when it was, it usually offered a large enough gap in savings to be substantial overall. You could save more by buying local, though your selection may not be as wide or the process as convenient.And if you're concerned about getting value out of your membership, Thrive Market guarantees its annual membership will pay for itself. If your membership fee was $60, but you only saved $40 in a year, they will automatically give you the difference ($20) in Thrive Market credit after you renew. Review of Thrive MarketThrive Market stocks popular brands like Annie's and Simple Mills, and has its own in-house Thrive Market brand too.Thrive Market/FacebookI ordered my groceries from Thrive Market in pursuit of a pantry not entirely reliant upon mac and cheese. In my first Thrive order, the total was $99.16 and the savings listed were $145.33. The savings claims held up, and I technically paid off the $60 annual membership fee in my first order. The food was delicious, and I discovered new better-for-you snacks. I also found Thrive to be surprisingly cheaper for some of my favorite skincare products, like this Aztec Clay Mask.Thrive Market carries ethically sourced meat and seafood in large bulk ""box"" options, but the options are slightly more limited than the average meat and seafood counter at a grocery store. I also don't have space in my freezer or fridge to handle over $100 worth of meat, but it could be another great place to see savings if you do.My colleague, Owen Burke, a lifelong fisherman with a background in commercial fishing and tending oyster bars, tried out Thrive's bevy of seafood on offer and had this to say:""I tried Thrive Market's Deluxe Seafood box, which runs you about $170. This is not something you'll want to buy unless you have a solid shelf of freezer space to spare, but I'll commend Thrive and call this nothing short of a feat on their part.""You're getting six different species of seafood. Everything I received was wild-caught and not in some far-flung waters using questionable methods and labor practices, something with which the industry is rife. These might not be the absolute best practices for every product, but Thrive is going leaps and bounds above your run-of-the-mill grocery store.""My favorite was the shrimp. They were superbly packed, vacuum-sealed, and packaged, which is among the most important things to do with any seafood. Mess that part up in any way (which, admittedly, is an easy thing to do), and you're fighting a losing game against oxidation and freezer burn. These shrimp still looked fresh after I thawed them and pulled them out of the packaging. They were beautifully peeled and de-veined, and they had no hint of off-flavor that you sometimes get when shrimp (especially frozen shrimp) aren't handled all that well. I give them an A+ here.""The sockeye salmon was also vacuum-sealed well. While I always appreciate skin-on salmon fillets, they often come at the cost of turned (brown) blood meat, which imparts that ""fishy"" flavor associated with frozen fish. This is per usual, though, when it comes to frozen salmon. But I recommend eating around it, if not to avoid the taste then to avoid the toxins blood meat bears. You'll also get four to five fillets, which means four to five servings (about six ounces a pop).""The lobster tails are very nicely processed, de-veined, and split so you can pop them right in the oven or on the grill. They're not vacuum-sealed but loose on a tray covered in plastic, which lends them to some freezer burn and ice buildup, but that really doesn't create the problem for lobster as it does for fish due to the tough quality of the meat.""The scallops I received provided two servings, and while they weren't vacuum-sealed as I would have liked, they were plenty tasty. Just note that these are not your jumbo-sized U10 (under 10/pound) scallops, but they were tasty and clean (free of residual sand and mud). You can find better scallops out there, but for what you're getting for the price of this box, I'd file no complaints.""It varies depending on what you get, but in all, you're looking at 10-15 meals of fresh-frozen (that's fish that was frozen fresh, as soon as it was processed) wild-caught protein of high quality. That's something like $11-$17 dollars a dish, which is about as good as you're going to do with high-quality fresh seafood unless you've got friends at the fishing docks.""The bottom lineThrive Market carries meat and fish to be ordered in bulk, but it isn't likely to be the average person's main source of meats.Thrive Market/FacebookI wish it were possible to find everything here (fresh fruit, more options for meat), but ultimately the discounts and the easy delivery make using Thrive worth it. And I wish it was always free shipping instead of just orders of $49 and up, but I typically clear that just by restocking my favorite basics. All in all, I liked using Thrive Market regularly for healthy snacks, healthy-but-fast foods, and kitchen basics like pasta sauce and olive oil.If you need an added incentive, Thrive Market also has a program called ""Thrive Gives,"" which gifts a free membership to someone in need through Feeding America and the Boys and Girls Club or directly through the site for every paid membership. The free membership also includes teachers, veterans, and first responders.

Según informes de EFE, Javier Garay, el último de los denominados seis históricos en la formación de Mocedades, recuerda que “Ana Bejerano ha sido una de las voces vascas más elegantes desde los 80”, destacando su “versatilidad y buen gusto”. En 1985, Amaya Uranga decidía dejar la conocida banda, y tal lugar fue ocupadao por Ana Bejarano, quien permaneció como solista principal de la agrupación hasta 1993. Ana grabó tres discos con Mocedades: Colores (1986), con el cantante Donovan; Sobreviviremos (1987) e Íntimamente (1992). Tras abandonar el grupo, se incorporó a la formación llamada Txarango, junto a Roberto Uranga y José Ipiña (exMocedades) y Amaya Saizar (exTrigo Limpio). En 2019, regresó de manera temporal a la banda y en 2021 participó en la gira del 50º aniversario del grupo. Mocedades se formó a finales de los años 60 en Bilbao.

67,White House press corps limits amount of journalists on briefings,2022-01-03,Washington journalists have decided that they’d rather give up face-to-face opportunities to press for answers from the White House than set aside their fears of catching Covid-19. Read Full Article at RT.com,"Reporters vote to slash attendance at daily briefings, citing ‘virulence’ of the Omicron variant Washington journalists have decided that they’d rather give up face-to-face opportunities to press for answers from the White House than set aside their fears of catching Covid-19. The White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) voted in an emergency board meeting on Sunday night to cut attendance at daily press briefings to 14 from the usual capacity of 49. The unanimous vote followed a failed effort last month to persuade White House press secretary Jen Psaki to move her briefings online amid the rapid spread of Covid-19’s Omicron strain. “Given the virulence of the spread, medical experts have once again advised that it would be prudent to substantially reduce the number of people working in the cramped, poorly ventilated workspace that we share,” WHCA president Steve Portnoy told members in an email. Per an email that just went out to members, the WHCA is reducing the number of available seats in the WH briefing room to 14 for the next several weeks at least.Last month, I wrote about the growing anxiety around Omicron exposure in the briefing room: https://t.co/uEwVR6BaZS pic.twitter.com/kZsb8qTJHC— Max Tani (@maxwelltani) January 3, 2022 Although Portnoy cited Omicron’s “virulence,” multiple studies have found that the variant is less dangerous than previous strains because it doesn’t appear to attack the lungs as aggressively. The press corps reportedly urged Psaki to hold briefings online rather than in-person, but White House officials told the WHCA that current protocols – including mask-wearing and requiring either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test – are sufficient. Under the new capacity limit, only reporters from Bloomberg, Reuters and the Associated Press will be able to regularly attend White House press briefings. Other journalists – including those known for being relatively tough on President Joe Biden – will have to wait their turn for rotating seats in the press room. Read more It’s not us, it’s you: Obama blames MSM and social media for Americans retreating to echo chambers Portnoy, a reporter for CBS News, told WHCA members that the decision to cut attendance will be revisited by January 21, with board members considering “case rates and the latest guidance from experts” to determine when to fully reopen White House briefings. Psaki told the Washington Post last month that current White House protocols are based on expert advice. “We don’t think it sends the right message to the country or the world to close the briefing room or pause in-person briefings.” When attendance was light at a December 23 briefing, she appeared to needle those reporters who had called for moving the events online, saying “only the bold and the brave” were attending the meeting. The US has set new records for Covid-19 infections in the past week, with Omicron’s rapid spread driving the surge. White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday that Omicron has so far proven to be milder than previous variants, and he expects new infections to start declining by the end of this month.",,https://www.rt.com/news/545087-white-house-press-skips-briefings/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,,rt

My brother Jay went to be with Jesus just a couple of hours ago,’ he said. ‘You’ve seen him walk the uphill battle and you guys helped carry him through so much.

72,Apple is now a $3 trillion company,2022-01-03,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Apple has become the first $3 trillion publicly traded company. The iPhone maker hit the milestone on Monday more than a year after surpassing the $2 trillion mark and three years after eclipsing $1 trillion. Apple’s huge success is due in large part to the iPhone, which revolutionized the smartphone industry and remains a cash cow for the company. But Apple continues to see strong momentum in its other businesses as well, with its services and Mac divisions reporting all-time highs in its Q4 2021 earnings. Apple isn’t the only company in the trillion-dollar club; Amazon, Google parent company Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla all have market caps exceeding $1 trillion. (Facebook parent company Meta breached the $1 trillion milestone in June but is currently sitting below it.) In recent years, Apple has also jostled with others for the crown of the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. It passed Saudi Aramco in July 2020, though it was overtaken for a time by Microsoft in October.",,https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22828277/apple-3-trillion-market-cap-company-earnings,,theverge
73,Nick Saban Offers Opinion on Expanding College Football Playoff,2022-01-03,The Alabama coach was clear about what expansion would do to the sport.,"The Alabama coach was clear about what expansion would do to the sport.View the original article to see embedded media.When asked about the potential of a College Football Playoff expansion, Alabama coach Nick Saban made his opinion clear: It doesn't add up. While Saban didn't agree with a reporter's assessment that Alabama's 27–6 semifinal win over No. 4 Cincinnati was a blowout, the seven-time national champion said he wasn't necessarily in favor of expansion. ""I can't speak to the other game, but it was a really hard fought game for us, I think,"" Saban said during media availability on Monday, per Tuscaloosa News. ""And we have a tremendous amount of respect for the team that we played.""""I don't know that expanding — if this is the best four teams and they played each other, I don't see the logic in, 'if we had more teams, there would be better games.' I don't know how that adds up. But I'm really not in position to answer that.""Saban added he thinks expanding the CFP could further lessen the importance of the remaining bowl games, something he said the sport has already experienced. ""There's a lot of other good teams that, whether it was their consistency and performance or whatever happened to them in championship games or whatever, may have had the opportunity to get in the playoffs that didn't,"" Saban said. ""But the more we expand the playoffs, the more we minimize bowl games, the importance of bowl games, which I said when we went before. So I don't think that's changed, and I think it's also come to fruition.""Alabama will face Georgia in the national title game on Jan. 10 in a rematch of the SEC championship game, which Alabama won 41–24. It will also be a rematch of the thrilling 2017 CFP national championship game that the Crimson Tide won in overtime. More College Football Coverage:New Year's Day Bowl Roundup: Comebacks, Broken Records and MoreForde: Matt Corral's Injury Is Why Players Who Skip Bowls Don't Deserve ScornNotre Dame Still Hasn't Won a Major Bowl Game Since Before the BCS EraOhio State's Jaxon Smith-Njigba Makes History in Wild Rose BowlFor more Alabama coverage, head over to Bama Central.","['Wire', 'cfp expansion', 'College Football', 'College', 'Breaking', 'Nick Saban']",https://www.si.com/college/2022/01/03/nick-saban-cfp-expansion-opinion-alabama-coach,,si

Jimmy Butler finally found a home in Miami after unsatisfactory stints with Timberwolves and the Sixers. In just his first season with the Heat, he made a trip to the NBA finals but injuries kept him from giving the Lakers a fair fight. Minnesota Timberwolves on the other hand have not been in the playoffs since his departure. To some extent, Karl Anthony Towns and co proved everything Jimmy said about them to be accurate. KAT is not a great leader and their record in the past few seasons makes it evident. Also Read: “I didn’t want the pressure of following John Stockton’s footsteps in Utah!”: Gilbert Arenas opens up about signing a $60 million deal with the Washington Wizards after just 2 years in the NBA despite being offered more by the Utah Jazz Karl Anthony Towns says they got the job done with Jimmy Butler and that’s what matters in the end. The matchup between Miami Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves is always highly anticipated because of the KAT-Jimmy rivalry. There’s always a lot of trash talk and pettiness when the two share the court. Jimmy believes KAT was soft and lacked the hunger to win. Their beef is always the highlight of the match when they face each other. However, the details of their relationship off the court are largely unknown.   KAT gives Jimmy Butler his flowers “Thank you Jimmy, appreciate you. No matter that we didn’t see eye to eye…We got the job done on the court.” (h/t @AhnFireDigital ) pic.twitter.com/XhcUHJNxEM — NBA Central (@TheNBACentral) January 3, 2022 In a recent Twitch stream, KAT decided to spread some love while he can. Due to Covid, he lost his mother last year. That clearly had a profound effect on him. The Minnesota big-man recalled all his ex-teammates and appreciated them. An unexpected name on the list was Jimmy Butler. He admitted that their relationship soured over the years but he is still grateful to Butler. They made the playoffs together one season and it wouldn’t have been possible without the Heat superstar. “Thank you Jimmy appreciate you. We didn’t see eye to eye we don’t have to but guess what we got the job done on the court. But we gave the Wolves a chance to be in the playoffs. We did that,” said Towns. “I see so much negativity on the internet I hate that. Spread love, I want to spread some appreciation flowers. Let’s get flowers more we losing people every day.” KAT is currently in health and safety protocols along with starter D’Angelo Russell. This affects Minnesota’s already faint chances to make the playoffs this season.

87,3 views: Pay attention to these startup theses in 2022,2022-01-03,"Natasha Mascarenhas, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim explain their perspectives on the startup models we can expect to see in 2022.","In retrospect, the rise of software as a service (SaaS) is obvious. But for years, the idea that software would not only be hosted by providers instead of purchased by customers, and rented, instead of owned outright, was far from anyone’s mind. SaaS has cemented its place in the epicenter of startup and Big Tech life, but it’s already being disrupted by the usage-based pricing movement. More startups are offering their services via a developer hook or API, and charging for customer usage over, say, a set number of seats for a predetermined period of time. Not everyone is sold on the on-demand move, but the competition for the software business model of the future underscores the point that tech models never rule the roost forever. So, what’s the next thesis that we will look back on? It may be more complicated than “a crypto strategy”, but we have thoughts on what will become the de facto startup model and strategy. To explore the concept, Natasha Mascarenhas, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim took the time to write up their expectations for 2022’s startup theses. Naturally, our notes cover a bit more than just business models, but as the beating heart of every startup is its model, the money element comes into play in all of our perspectives. Alex: 2022 is when open source will become the de facto startup model I’ve spoken with lots of founders over the years, and while I do have a more business focus than an early-stage bent, I do get to chat with founders building the early blocks of their businesses on a regular basis. What hit me this year, especially towards the latter half, was just how frequently I ran into bright folks building businesses that had an open source component. We all know that open source isn’t new as a business concept. Red Hat was founded in the tech equivalent of the neolithic era, and has done well throughout its life. But startups building companies atop open source code are taking up a greater portion of their industry than before, and I think I know why. Or at least I have a hunch. It’s about control, basically. Software was once something that you bought. Actually, if you go back far enough, you can find examples of early PC manufacturers offering full software suites with their hardware, but that model died off as the world realized that open platforms were the way forward. From there, software bumbled along as a thing that consumers and corporations could buy. “Buy” is the key word here. Folks bought closed source code from companies, and then ran it on their own systems, either personal or mainframe. Then, the cloud came along, and hosted software took off. Here again, however, the code was still largely closed source. You didn’t get a copy of Slack’s code per se, but you could rent access to its service for your team. As software transformed from a series of discrete sales to a stream of recurring payments, SaaS took off, and investors cheered it on. This brings us almost to the modern moment, but not quite. On-demand pricing began to supplant SaaS as the de facto sales model of the software world — as Anna notes below — with Twilio as its champion, just as Salesforce was once for the SaaS market.","['Cloud', 'Enterprise', 'Fundings & Exits', 'SaaS', 'Startups', 'TC', 'alex wilhelm', 'articles', 'as-a-service', 'business model', 'cloud applications', 'cloud computing', 'dynamic pricing', 'EC News Analysis', 'entrepreneurship', 'Forbes', 'Marketing', 'natasha mascarenhas', 'Nike', 'oracle', 'Pricing', 'red hat', 'Salesforce', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'software engineers', 'Spotify', 'Startup company', 'tiktok', 'Twilio', 'venture capital']",https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/3-views-pay-attention-to-these-startup-theses-in-2022/,,techcrunch

As part of the latest development regarding the much anticipated 15th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the Ahmedabad-based franchise have reportedly roped-in former Indian pacer Ashish Nehra as their head coach for IPL 2022. Ahmedabad will, alongside Lucknow join the eight existing IPL franchises to partake in this year’s IPL. The Lucknow IPL team has already announced former Zimbabwean skipper Andy Flower as their head coach followed by Vijay Dahiya and Gautam Gambhir as their assistant coach and mentor respectively for the upcoming season. Lucknow IPL Team appointed Andy Flower as head coach. Here are the words from him about new beginnings : “I am incredibly excited to be joining the new Lucknow franchise and I am very grateful for the opportunity. Since my very first tour to India in 1993, I have always love — Official Lucknow IPL Team (@TeamLucknowIPL_) January 3, 2022 The CVC Capitals- the ownership firm of the Ahmedabad franchise had landed itself in a bit of some controversy, after its alleged link with betting firms abroad surfaced post its successful bidding. It is worth of a mention that bidding/betting, unlike some countries, is not legal in India. The IPL Governing council, as a result had formed a committee to address the matter on December 4, with the aim hand a go-ahead to the franchise with the ‘Letter of Intent’. While the issue seems to be finally settled and the matter pertaining the franchises’ participation resolved, they have gone ahead with finalizing the names of their coaching and support staff for their debut season this year. Ahmedabad IPL team coaching staff 2022: Nehra head coach; Gary Kirsten likely to be mentor With Nehra’s appointment as head coach nearly confirmed, the reports also state that World Cup-winning former India coach Gary Kirsten will be the ‘Mentor’ of the franchise. Also, former England opening batter Vikram Solanki, is in line to become the team’s ‘Director of Cricket’. Nehra has earlier coached the Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore where Kirsten was also involved for a couple of seasons. “As far as I have heard, they have signed Ashish as their head coach and someone who would be in overall charge of the franchise. Solanki will be the ‘Director of Cricket’ and also expected to double up as batting coach and Kirsten will be in a mentorship role,” a senior IPL source told PTI on conditions of anonymity. “The Ahmedabad franchise can’t announce it formally as it is a BCCI diktat and they can only make a formal announcement after they get the LOI. The head honchos of Ahmedabad franchise has already interviewed the trio and short-listed them for the season,” the source said.

Both the teams however, have reportedly named their 3 respective players who have been negotiated with before the mega auction which is likely to take place by the end of January.       The post Ahmedabad IPL team coaching staff 2022: Will Ashish Nehra be the head coach of Ahmedabad team in IPL 2022? appeared first on The SportsRush.","['Cricket', 'Ahmedabad IPL team', 'Ashish Nehra', 'IPL 2022']",https://thesportsrush.com/cricket-news-ahmedabad-ipl-team-coaching-staff-2022-will-ashish-nehra-be-the-head-coach-of-ahmedabad-team-in-ipl-2022/,,thesportsrush

100,Why Boeing Stock Rose Today,2022-01-03,Investors took heart from a positive statement from a key aerospace supplier and a change of sentiment helped the sector early in 2022.,"Shares of Boeing (NYSE: BA) rose 3.6% as of 11 a.m. ET on Monday. The move probably comes from a combination of two factors. First, the CEO of France's aerospace giant Safran gave a newspaper interview and told investors the company would make 12,000 hires in 2022 due to his confidence in the aerospace recovery. Safran is one of the largest aerospace companies in the world, with expected revenue of 15.6 billion euros in 2021. In addition, it's a joint venture partner of General Electric (NYSE: GE) in CFM International, a commercial engine manufacturer with engines on the Airbus A320 NEO and the Boeing 737 MAX. As such, what Safran says matters. It's interesting to note that GE stock and others in aerospace are up today.Second, it's likely that investors are taking a look at some of the losers on the Dow last year and deciding that now is an excellent time to take advantage to play an aerospace recovery.Continue reading",,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/03/why-boeing-stock-rose-today/?source=iedfolrf0000001,,fool

Per NFL Network, when Buccaneers coaches asked Brown in the to enter the game, Brown told them he did not want to play at risk of further injuring his ankle.

103,Rare Lou Reed demos released and quickly withdrawn in apparent copyright dump,2022-01-03,A 17-track project titled 'I’m So Free: The 1971 RCA Demos' was released over the Christmas period The post Rare Lou Reed demos released and quickly withdrawn in apparent copyright dump appeared first on NME.,"A collection of rare Lou Reed demos were released over the holiday period and then quickly withdrawn in an apparent copyright dump. READ MORE: The Velvet Underground review: revisionist doc reworks narrative of New York rock and rollers According to Variety, RCA/Sony Music uploaded a 17-track album of Lou Reed demos to iTunes in Europe on December 23 titled ‘I’m So Free: The 1971 RCA Demos’. It was then removed a couple of days later. Matthew Goody, the author of Needles And Plastic: Flying Nun Records, 1981–1988, took to social media last Thursday (December 30) to point out that the album had been released, sharing a link that previewed the album’s artwork. “Apparently Lou Reed’s RCA demos from 1971 were dumped on Apple Music in Europe on Xmas Eve,” he tweeted. “No sign they’ll be available anywhere else.” Apparently Lou Reed's RCA demos from 1971 were dumped on Apple Music in Europe on Xmas Eve. No sign they'll be available anywhere else: https://t.co/WniMgCiXwL — Matthew Goody (@m_c_goody) December 30, 2021 The tracklist for ‘I’m So Free’ includes rough versions of nearly every song from Reed’s self-titled 1972 debut solo album and his breakthrough follow-up, ‘Transformer’, although two tracks, ‘Kill Your Sons’ and ‘She’s My Best Friend’, were not officially released until his 1976 sixth album ‘Coney Island Baby’. The album, which also includes songs like ‘Perfect Day’, ‘I’m Sticking With You’, ‘Ride Into The Sun’ and others, appears to be made up of demos that have been doing the rounds for several years – see the full tracklist below. ‘I’m So Free: The 1971 RCA Demos’ tracklist: ‘Perfect Day (Demo – Takes 1 & 2)’ ‘I’m So Free (Demo)’ ‘Wild Child (Demo)’ ‘I’m Sticking with You (Demo – Take 2)’ ‘Lisa Says (Demo)’ ‘Going Down (Demo – Take 2)’ ‘I Love You (Demo)’ ‘New York Telephone Conversation (Demo)’ ‘She’s My Best Friend (Demo)’ ‘Kill Your Sons (Demo)’ ‘Berlin (Demo)’ ‘Ocean (Demo – Takes 1 & 2)’ ‘Ride Into the Sun (Demo – Take 2)’ ‘Hangin’ Around (Demo – Take 2)’ ‘Love Makes You Feel (Demo – Take 2)’ ‘I Can’t Stand It (Demo)’ ‘Walk It And Talk It (Demo)’ The reason for the brief release looks to be an apparent copyright dump to extend RCA/Sony Music’s ownership of the recordings. Reed died of liver disease on October 27, 2013. NME has reached out to RCA/Sony Music for comment. Copyright-extension releases have become commonplace in recent years. Sound recordings are protected for 50 years after they are published, and can be extended to 70 years as long as they are “lawfully communicated to the public” within the first 50 years. Previously, some publishers have released collections of recordings, such as The Beatles’ 2013 album ‘Bootleg Recordings 1963’. Others, perhaps less eager to share early, unfinished versions of songs with the world, have pushed the boundaries of what it means to publish their music. In 2013, a Bob Dylan compilation, literally published as ‘The Copyright Extension Collection, Volume 1’, was released. Sold only in Europe, just 100 were issued. In January 2020, a collection of rare and unpublished Rolling Stones recordings were published to YouTube and then mysteriously removed within hours. Meanwhile, last month, Dave Navarro of Jane’s Addiction and Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis reunited for a live cover of Lou Reed’s ‘Walk On The Wild Side’. The two rock acts came together during Navarro’s Above Ground charity concert on December 20 to raise awareness and funds for mental health for people in the music industry under the MusiCares programme.

105,Warzone players demand fix for pay-to-win invisible skin ruining the game,2022-01-03,Warzone players are demanding that Raven Software fix the invisible Battle Pass skin that has been plaguing Caldera and Rebirth Island. The post Warzone players demand fix for pay-to-win invisible skin ruining the game appeared first on Charlie INTEL.,"An invisible Operator skin has been ruining matches of Warzone Pacific since the launch of Season 1, and players are demanding the pay-to-win outfit gets fixed. With the majority of Warzone’s developers being off work for the holidays, a number of game-breaking bugs and glitches have plagued Caldera and Rebirth Island. Broken Shotguns, players respawning with their loadouts, and broken audio are just a few of the issues. However, players have completely lost patience with the Awoken Francis skin, which turns players completely invisible – except for a floating orange mask. Now that Raven Software are returning from their holiday break, players are demanding a fix. Warzone has had trouble with invisible skins in the past, with the Forest Spirit bundle turning players invisible, as well as the Attack Helicopters turning any skin invisible. Read more: Warzone Akimbo Pistol loadout is destroying players in close quarters In Warzone Pacific Caldera, it’s the paid Tier 100 Battle Pass skin, Awoken Francis, that’s making players impossible to see at a distance. This issue has been known for some time, but players have only become more and more frustrated with it going unacknowledged. Reddit continues to be ablaze with players complaining about the skin and demanding it fixed. ‘evilmonk234‘ asked “How could Raven let a skin be invisible for more than a day?” They said it’s “honestly so ridiculous they can’t test to see if a skin is f**king invisible past 30m.” How could Raven let a skin (paid ofc) be invisible for more than a day? Fuck this game from CODWarzone They clarified that they don’t blame the devs for not fixing it over the holidays, but that “they should not release it this way in the first place. At the very least, when you hear about it early on, just remove the skin until it’s fixed.” Read more: Secret Warzone buffs make “aimbot” Cluster Strikes impossible to survive evilmonk234 isn’t alone, as players have been complaining over the entirety of the holiday period. But, now that Raven Software devs have returned to work, we expect this glitch to be fixed soon.

107,Why Gevo Stock Is Up Nearly 14% Today,2022-01-03,"Investors are connecting a couple of semirelated dots, though the timing of their conclusions is a little suspicious.","Shares of biofuels producer Gevo (NASDAQ: GEVO) were up almost 14% as of 12:05 p.m. ET Monday, starting the new year off with a bang thanks to similarly strong bullish interest in companies closely associated with Gevo's flagship product.After Gevo ended 2021 on a mostly bearish foot, and at a new 52-week low, investors are changing their minds about the stock. The rally apparently stems from the fact that the company makes and markets liquid hydrocarbons using an approach that's completely carbon neutral. Its fuels can be used in a variety of ways, though its potential as a jet fuel is easily the most promising game changer.To this end, Gevo shareholders can thank the renewed bullishness behind airline stocks for Monday's big gains. Shares of Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and American Airlines are up 3.5%, 4.6%, and 4.8%, respectively, today despite a spate of COVID-prompted flight cancellations during the busy holiday season. Investors are looking past these temporary disruptions and still seeing a bigger-picture rebound for the air travel industry. That post-pandemic rebound, however, is converging with an even bigger shift toward cleaner energy solutions.Continue reading",,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/03/why-gevo-is-up-than-13-today/?source=iedfolrf0000001,,fool
108,A Fan Wrote Betty White a Letter Every Week for Almost 15 Years,2022-01-03,"Betty White died on December 31, 2021. Before her death, she received many letters from her dedicated fans.","Betty White, best known for playing Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, was loved by fans around the world. White was deeply touched by a fan who wrote her every week for 15 years. Betty White’s manager said she was ‘beloved’ by fans Betty White | Desiree Navarro/FilmMagic White’s manager, Jeff Witjas, told People magazine he often told The Golden Girls star how much fans loved her. He wanted to make her aware of the admiration fans had for her. Witjas says he’s not sure if White really understood how deeply fans cared for her. “Even when she wasn’t working, I said, ‘Betty, millions of people out there are still asking for you,’” said Witjas. “You’re getting your fan letters. I’m getting offers for you.’ I don’t know if she ever embraced it, [or] really, really felt it. The extent of it. I really don’t.” Witjas said he wanted White to know she was still important to so many people. “I would always reinforce it with her because I always felt she should know that,” he continued. “I never wanted her to think while she was sitting at home, that the world has passed her by. It never did.” One fan wrote Betty White a letter every week for 15 years One example of the love fans had for White was demonstrated by a fan who wrote a letter to her every week for 15 years. White was so moved by the fan’s loyalty that she wrote about it in her book, Betty White in Person. “Her name was Evelyn Martin, and her letters would come without fail every Monday morning,” wrote White. She said Martin would always send one sheet that had writing on both sides. White noticed the woman would always stop on the second page, even if she was in the middle of a sentence. The end of her notes would say, “Love Evelyn.” Martin liked to fill White in on the details of her life. She would tell her about her friends and the club meetings she attended. However, White said she didn’t tell her much about herself. One thing Martin did make clear was that she loved Christmas. She would celebrate until Spring and then write about how much she was looking forward to next Christmas. White said her husband, Allen Ludden, enjoyed Martin’s letters. He began sending her Christmas wreaths every year. Martin’s notes continued to arrive every Monday. However, one day, White received a letter with handwriting she didn’t recognize. It was a note from Martin’s neighbor. The neighbor let White know that Martin died in her sleep. Betty White appreciated the fan mail she received White said she also had a fan who wrote to her for 30 years. There were also fans whose children and then grandchildren began writing her. “In a couple of cases, we’re on our third generation,” marveled White in her book. White said she received letters from fans of all ethnic backgrounds, ages, and economic levels. She appreciated the letters because they allowed her to get to know the people who watched her on TV. She said through these notes, she has “gone through their marriages and divorces,” and “watched their children grow.” White was flattered that her fans wanted to make her a part of their lives. They saw her as a dear friend. RELATED: Betty White Was Hurt By a Viewer Who Listed Everything They Couldn’t Stand About Her Follow Sheiresa Ngo on Twitter.

Their father, Donald Trump, has called James’ investigation politically motivated. Read Full Article at RT.com","Lawyers for the two Trumps say they won’t comply New York Attorney General Letitia James has subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump as part of an inquiry into the Trump family business. Their father, Donald Trump, has called James’ investigation politically motivated. The subpoenas for the two Trump siblings were served at the beginning of December, the New York Times reported on Monday. According to a court document cited by multiple media outlets, lawyers for the pair will file motions to quash the legal writs. Former President Donald Trump was also subpoenaed in December, and responded by suing James. Trump claims that James’ two-year investigation has violated his civil rights, with his lawyers describing the probe as “partisan,” and “a bitter crusade” by James to “punish her political opponents.” Read more Trump sues NY attorney general Trump’s suit claims that James’ investigation essentially boils down to a “baseless” fishing expedition, with the former president’s lawyers citing public tweets by James promising legal action against Trump as evidence. “You & your cronies aren't above the law,” she tweeted to former Trump lawyer MIchael Cohen in 2018. “Every day we're getting closer to justice. Just wait until I'm in the Attorney General’s office.” James became New York’s top prosecutor later that year, having made investigating Trump a key campaign promise. With elections coming up this November, James briefly explored a run for governor of the Empire State, but dropped out of contention last month to focus her efforts on prosecuting the former president. James’ investigation is a civil one, and focuses on whether Trump inflated the value of the Trump Organization’s assets to obtain loans, and devalued them elsewhere to obtain tax breaks.  A separate criminal investigation led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is also probing whether Trump lied about the value of his assets to banks and tax authorities. Though Vance’s term as Manhattan DA ran out on January 1, his office, now under the leadership of Alvin Bragg, will continue the investigation. Last month, Vance also subpoenaed Trump to provide evidence, though Trump has yet to comply with the order.",,https://www.rt.com/news/545082-trump-jr-subpoena-investigation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,,rt

At first the orb appears to be being carried by a person – but then it inexplicably drops to a lower level, sparking speculation that it could have been a ghost.The incident was caught on camera in a residential street on December 12 and does appear to be a person carrying a mobile phone or another form of light.The illumination initially appears from behind a parked car but then moves down. Chris Romer, the chairman of the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena, hailed the incident as among the best sighting of 2021. He said: ‘It’s amazing – it’s a real mystery why the light dropped.‘It’s some of the best footage I’ve seen this year.’ Local folklorist David Sivier said of the strange light movements: ‘My guess is that it has a natural explanation’ But he added that incident is probably does involve someone carrying a mobile phone with the torch setting on. The mum who captured the footage on her outdoor camera said she was baffled despite claiming to not believe in ‘paranormal things’. She said: ‘It starts off as half a person and ends as a ball.‘One of my neighbours has a camera and it didn’t pick this up. If it was someone walking then the other camera would have caught it.‘The man next door said before there were houses on this road there was a company who made bricks. And they wore head torches. So it could be the ghost of one of them.’Dr Becky Smith, a parapsychologist, is unconvinced by claims of supernatural events. She said: ‘I’m not a video footage expert, but I’m afraid I don’t believe it’s a ghost.‘I’m confused by why the figure appears to duck down about halfway through, but not enough to make me think it’s anything paranormal.’ Others were more inclined to speculate on the possible involvement of spirits.Local folklorist Dr David Sivier said: ‘The bumpy motion of the light makes me wonder if it’s a light being carried by someone, who for some reason doesn’t appear in the image.

The letter stops short of explicitly saying Square Enix will put NFTs into games, saying that the company is watching the technology and plans to “develop a business accordingly, with an eye to potentially issuing our own tokens in the future.” Matsuda also acknowledges lots of players have not been happy with the whole NFTs in gaming thing even as publishers keep on trying to get into that arena: “I realize that some people who ‘play to have fun’ and who currently form the majority of players have voiced their reservations toward these new trends, and understandably so. However, I believe that there will be a certain number of people whose motivation is to ‘play to contribute,’ by which I mean to help make the game more exciting. Traditional gaming has offered no explicit incentive to this latter group of people, who were motivated strictly by such inconsistent personal feelings as goodwill and volunteer spirit. With advances in token economies, users will be provided with explicit incentives, thereby resulting not only in greater consistency in their motivation, but also creating a tangible upside to their creative efforts.” He then goes on to say “by designing viable token economies into our games, we will enable self-sustaining game growth” and cites this new potential ecosystem as “decentralized gaming”. This sees Square Enix joining the likes of Sega, Ubisoft and EA who’ve all explored blockchain gaming and the potential use of NFTs in the gaming world recently – their first efforts meeting wit ah major public backlash. This letter has as well, the reaction from those who “play to have fun” have voiced their concerns on social media about the tokenization of gameplay, the ‘play to contribute’ model being the foothold for ‘play to earn’ models to follow, and of course the ongoing and costly environmental impact of blockchain technologies and the scepticism over NFTs. a New Year's letter from the Square Enix president talks about new tech/concepts including NFTs, the metaverse, and particularly how blockchain games ""hold the potential to enable self-sustaining game growth"" https://t.co/qtdFCvQdeB pic.twitter.com/FOG4S9Hpgb — Wario64 (@Wario64) January 1, 2022 Source: Square Enix The post Square Enix Chief Hopes For NFT Future appeared first on Dark Horizons.",,https://www.darkhorizons.com/square-enix-chief-hopes-for-nft-future/,,darkhorizons

Jurgen Klopp’s side were beating Chelsea 2-0 at Stamford Bridge last night in a must-win Premier League game. But Liverpool wound up drawing 2-2 in what might be a coffin nail for their title aspirations. The Reds are 11 points behind leaders Manchester City, who have played one game more. Even still, it’s very difficult seeing Liverpool making up that deficit. “Maeda will set the tone for Ange at Celtic” | Japanese football expert Sam RobsonBridTV7543“Maeda will set the tone for Ange at Celtic” | Japanese football expert Sam Robson934497934497centerUCqUPn73T2WxGyzCdtLe8m7g67 Hail Hail (Youtube)https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwng3RIc-bAXurA5yt1Vj63uuVOBD1RQ9n6j_XKhD=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj13872 And Jamie O’Hara has claimed the Premier League title race is done and dusted, stressing that Pep Guardiola’s side won’t drop that many points.

It’s well and truly over. “Liverpool had to win that game. They’re conceding too many goals. Chelsea are conceding too many goals.” Double blow To make matters worse, Liverpool will now lose Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah. The Reds attackers – who scored the goals against Chelsea – have left for their country’s Africa Cup of Nations campaign. Losing both of those for most of January is an absolute hammer blow and O’Hara is right – the Merseysiders are finished as far as winning the Premier League title goes.

The Lille centre-back has been heavily linked with a £30 million move to St James’s Park. The French outfit have rejected an approach by Newcastle. However, The Telegraph claims the situation is ‘complicated’. Newcastle’s hopes aren’t entirely dead in the water because The Telegraph report that Botman himself is ‘fascinated’ by Saudi Public Investment Fund’s project on Tyneside. The Magpies’ owners have a reported fortune of £320 billion, making the North-East very appealing in the near future. “Maeda will set the tone for Ange at Celtic” | Japanese football expert Sam RobsonBridTV7543“Maeda will set the tone for Ange at Celtic” | Japanese football expert Sam Robson934497934497centerUCqUPn73T2WxGyzCdtLe8m7g67 Hail Hail (Youtube)https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwng3RIc-bAXurA5yt1Vj63uuVOBD1RQ9n6j_XKhD=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj13872 And it seems like Botman himself is willing to be part of it. That’s the good news. The bad news, going by The Telegraph, is that Newcastle’s wealth might not mean much. In the same report, journalist Luke Edwards writes that the Ligue 1 side are under no pressure to sell the 21-year-old Dutchman. And frankly, the relegation-threatened side cannot and must not spend the whole of January trying to get someone unless they’re positive they can succeed. Time is of the essence for Newcastle. Eddie Howe’s side are 19th in the Premier League table and if there isn’t genuine optimism that Botman can be bought, they need to move on to other targets.

Fernando Alonso had a lengthy spell in Formula 1 before leaving for other forms of Motorsports. However, it is perceived that annoyance with poor McLaren car powered by Honda engine forced him to leave the sport. Though, in 2021, the Spaniard returned to F1 with Alpine, with massive excitement. When in a media interaction asked what led to this excitement, the Spaniard replied. Without a doubt, THE best of 2021!!! #oleoleole 2⃣0⃣2⃣2⃣ DON’T LET ME DOWN!!! pic.twitter.com/EOZz9p91Oo — Museo y Circuito Fernando Alonso (@CircuitoMuseoFA) December 31, 2021 “I probably disagree with that because when I joined Ferrari, I had exactly the same questions from you guys. I remember perfectly answering questions, why do you feel so happy now? Is being in an Italian team and you are Spanish a better fit and you feel happy?” “I said, yes, maybe it’s because of that and now we have the same sense of humour. We have the same Latin characters, so maybe that’s the reason why I’m happy.” “Then I came back to McLaren in 2015, and it was the same comments, why are you so happy now because in Ferrari, you felt a little bit down the last two years and frustrated. “And now you seem that even if you are not fighting for the championship and it was the bad seasons of Honda, et cetera, you’re still quite happy off track. So why that change from Fernando?” “Then when I was in endurance or the car on Indy, why you are so much relaxed now in Formula 1, you seem frustrated, et cetera, and now, it’s the same comment.” Also read: Former F1 driver thinks Fernando Alonso was too impatient with Honda Rivalry with Lewis Hamilton tarnished the image of Fernando Alonso Alonso further claims that his rivalry with Hamilton harmed him.

117,Man abducted in China at age 4 reunites with family decades later using hand-drawn map of his childhood home,2022-01-03,"Li Jingwei couldn't remember his birth name after being abducted as a child, but he remembered how to draw his home village and posted a map online.","As many as 70,000 children are estimated to be kidnapped every year in China for illegal adoption, forced labor or sex trafficking, making it one of the world’s biggest markets for abducted children, according to the state-run newspaper China Daily.AP Photo/Andy Wong Li Jingwei, a Chinese man who was abducted in the 1980s, was reunited with his parents on January 1. Police used a map of Li's home village that he drew by hand to locate his family, according to VICE. Li couldn't remember his birth name but could remember what his hometown looked like, CNN reported. Police reunited a Chinese man with his parents decades after his abduction using a map of his home village that he drew by hand. CNN reported that Li Jingwei was abducted from his home village in Yunnan province in 1988 by a man who his family knew, citing a report from The Paper, a state-run Chinese media outlet.Li, now 37, knew he had been abducted when he was 4-years-old, but he could not remember his birth name, the name of his village, or his parents' names, VICE reported. Li was taken to live with another family in Henan province after his abduction, The Paper reported. Though he couldn't remember the name of his village, Li could remember aspects of the town, such as where the herds of water buffalo were, the rice patties and ponds near his home, and the directions of roads and rivers, the report says.On December 24, Li posted a video on Douyin, China's version of TikTok, asking for help to find his family, according to VICE. The video showed a hand-drawn map of his home village.""I'm a child who's finding his home,"" Li said in the video, according to VICE. ""I was taken to Henan by a bald neighbor around 1989, when I was about four years old. This is a map of my home area that I have drawn from memory.""Li said in the video that he didn't even know if his family was still looking for him because ""so many years"" had passed, The Paper reported.""I want to be able to see my parents again while they are still here,"" Li reportedly said in the video.Police used Li's drawing to locate his birth mother in the city of Zhaotong in Yunnan province, The Paper reported. According to VICE, Li's mother accurately described a scar on his chin in a phone call with Li, and DNA tests confirmed they were related on December 28. Li was reunited with his mother on January 1 at a police station in Henan. Stories about Li's reunion with his parents have gained millions of views on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, according to VICE. Many people expressed sympathy for his mother and anger at the human trafficker who took him from his family, according to the outlet. Child abduction has been an issue in China for many years due to the country's former one-child policy, which was put in place in the 1980s and hit families with excessive fines for having more than one child. Boys were traditionally seen as more likely to continue the family line, which led to a surge in Chinese families giving up baby girls for adoption and opened a black market for baby boys, according to CNN.The policy has been relaxed in recent years and now allows for couples to have three children. But some young couples in China told Insider's Cheryl Teh that most of their peers aren't interested in having more than one child, because the cost of raising children is so high in China.Read the original article on Insider","['News', 'International', 'map', 'China', 'Missing', 'Missing person', 'missing persons case', 'Crime', 'kidnap', 'Kidnapped']",https://www.insider.com/man-abducted-in-china-uses-hand-drawn-map-reunite-family-2022-1,,insider

The German international is out of contract in the summer. He has been a mainstay under Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel since he took over around a year ago. Rudiger helped the Blues win the Champions League last term. He has also been a key player this term. Thomas Tuchel leads Premier League winners and losers Rudiger has played the full 90 minutes in all but one of Chelsea’s Premier League games in 2021/22. He penned a five-year deal when he joined them for £29m from Roma in 2017. Man Utd have been linked with the defender in recent weeks. But Sky Sports have revealed that they are not in talks with his representatives, even though Ralf Ragnick is an “admirer” of him. They have stated that Real Madrid, PSG, Bayern Munich and Juventus have all “opened talks” with the 28-year-old. Rudiger is now able to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with another club as his current deal expires in less than six months. Elsewhere, Graeme Souness has called for Romelu Lukaku to apologise following his “ridiculous” interview. During the interview in question, the striker said that he was “not happy” with his role at Chelsea. Souness said: “We’re trying to understand how a player could get his head where it has been to come out with such a ridiculous and damaging statement. “I think he has come back (from injury), he’s not gone straight into the team, (there is) enormous disappointment attached to that and he has come out with the nonsense he has come out with. It is totally disrespectful. “He’s 29 years old (actually 28), he’s not 19. He should have known better that this statement damages the football club enormously. “It is like walking into the dressing room and saying to the other 25 guys, ‘I don’t want to be with you anymore’. I know what I’d be like, ‘if you don’t fancy it here, there’s the… door, and on you go. “He has got to hold his hand up and say it wasn’t the right place, ‘I made a mistake, I apologise unreservedly’. “He has lit a fire, a fire that only he can put out. The solution has to come from him. He can’t be expected to be welcomed back into the fold if he is unrepentant. “He has got to find a way of saying, ‘Sorry I’ve got it wrong’.” The post Report reveals four clubs ‘in talks’ with Chelsea star Rudiger appeared first on Football365.","['All The News', 'Chelsea', 'Front Page', 'Home Page', 'Manchester United', 'News', 'Antonio Rüdiger']",https://www.football365.com/news/report-reveals-four-clubs-talks-with-chelsea-star-rudiger-rangnick-man-utd,,football365

We’ll save the solemn reminiscing for another day because, despite the negative, there has been a lot to be thankful for this year. I recently shared the Top 10 articles of 2021 from Chrome Unboxed and now, it’s time to take a look at the top-performing YouTube videos of the year. As with our Top 10 posts, this is going to be a rundown of our Top 5 YouTube videos of 2021 based solely on the number of views. Also like our article roundup, there are some honorable mentions for videos that made it into the Top 5 but weren’t actually produced in 2021. They’ll get some love but won’t grace the official list. Kicking off the list at number 5 is, not surprisingly, a little video about Google’s latest flagship phones – the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The Tensor-powered flagships have made the Best of lists of many tech sites and YouTube channels and for good reason. Google has a hit on its hands and the Pixel 6 gives us hope that Google has finally become a true smartphone competitor. Our #5 YouTube video of 2021 is the unboxing and impressions of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. #5: Pixel 6 & Pixel 6 Pro Unboxing Coming in at number 4, the first 11th Gen Tiger Lake Chromebook to hit the market came in the form of a 15.6″ convertible from ASUS. This Chromebook was not only a solid overall device, it was a complete 180 from ASUS’ recent offerings that were drastically overpriced and well below our idea of what a premium Chromebook should be. Since then, ASUS continued to bring the hits with two more ultra-premium devices that both made our Best of 2021 list for all the right reasons. The number 4 video of 2021: The ASUS Chromebook CX5500 review. #4: ASUS Chromebook CX5 Review: Fastest Chromebook Yet Some of our most popular video content seems to regularly revolve around budget-minded devices. The number three video of 2021 happens to be just that. We’ve seen a slew of MediaTek-powered Chromebooks hit shelves over the past 12 months and many of the “cheap” models can be had for well under $200. In this video, Robby breaks down whether or not it’s worth spending your hard-earned money on the HP Chromebook 11a that is frequently on sale for $179 or less. #3: Is The Sub-$200 HP Chromebook 11a Worth It? The explosion of Android apps on Chrome OS, USI pens, and tablet form-factors has led to the accelerated advancement of all sorts of handwriting and drawing applications designed to work well on Chromebooks. Google has taken some of the technology amassed over the years and released an in-house note-taking app called Cursive. It was a bit of a rocky start but over time, Cursive has become a decent little tool in the Chrome OS arsenal. The number two video of 2021 is a quick hands-on of Google’s Cursive app. #2: Hands-on With Cursive Honorable Mention As promised, we have an honorable mention on the list. There were a few videos that made it into the top 10 that weren’t published in 2021 but this is, hands-down, the number one video of the year, and it was produced way back in 2018. This video just keeps on chugging and it has garnered just shy of 2 million views to date. At the time, the idea seemed simple. It was right after Christmas and we figured that it would be a good idea to do a little video on how to familiarize yourself with your new Chromebook as many people were converting to the platform. Since then, it continues to be one of the most searched how-tos on the web in the Chrome OS space and it makes this one of our top-performing videos of all time. So, the honorable mention goes to Got A New Chromebook? 10 Things You Need To Know. Got A New Chromebook? 10 Things You Need To Know And now we have arrived at number one. While we got our start with unboxings and hardware reviews, Chrome Unboxed has branched out into a wide range of areas that cover Google-related products. Some of our most popular content revolves around software and services. Chrome OS is not an exception to that rule. Whenever a major update to Chrome OS is released, users are extremely interested in hearing about new features and secret tricks that help make the most out of a Chromebook. From Phone Hub to the new Tote and everything in between, Chrome OS 89 was chock full of new features and Robby’s highlight video quickly caught fire and took off. It is officially the number one Chrome Unboxed YouTube video of 2021 and we’re pretty proud of this little guy. #1: Chrome OS 89: All The Best New Features Welp, that’s a wrap. 2021 was a big year for us here at Chrome Unboxed but we’re just getting started. 2022 is going to be monumental for the Chromebook space and we will be churning out more content than ever before.

St. Elizabeth said it is pausing scheduling on same-day and elective surgeries that require admissions through Jan. 8 and they are halting non-emergent procedures until mid-January. Cases at the Northern Kentucky hospital have been rapidly climbing, according to a spokesperson with St. Elizabeth. ""Our community is in the midst of a surge from a mix of Delta variant infections and Omicron variant infections, the latter strain having a much shorter doubling time and infection rate,"" said Guy Karrik, manager of media relations and communications at St. Elizabeth. ""At the conclusion of the holiday season and people gathering, we are expecting to see incidence rates increase further in our region over the next few weeks.""A spokesperson with TriHealth said it is doing the same, but did not provide a timeline for how long they expect to delay procedures. ""To keep hospital beds available during this COVID surge, we are making operational changes such as limiting elective surgeries and procedures that require hospital admissions and keeping patients longer in the post-anesthesia care units to avoid taking up patient beds needed for care,"" said Matt Mattingly, senior public relations consultant with TriHealth.

In her native Brazil, Anitta reigns as the country’s highest streamed artist, and she made history this year as the country’s first musical export to perform at the MTV VMAs.

132,Your mom owns Web 2.0,2022-01-03,"I promise that this is not all a tech elite rubber-noodle fight. The drama, instead, highlights an interesting issue that venture capital has with the web3 world.","We’ve been gifted another episode of “Tech Versus Tech: Crypto Edition” today. The argument among the tech elite about just who owns what in the Web 2.0 and web3 worlds continued this weekend. And once again the dustup featured former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and a16z, the investing firm best known in recent years for its capital deployments into the blockchain domain. Dorsey, after pulling the rip cord from his perch atop Twitter and rebranding his fintech firm Square to the more crypto-friendly “Block,” has decided to talk more publicly about his views. And views he has. The well-known tech exec is a known Bitcoin fan, which you might think would slot in nicely with a16z’s general crypto bullishness. It does not. Jack, web3, and who owns what We dug into the early Dorsey-versus-a16z arguments here, but will provide a summary for those of you who would prefer something brief. Dorsey’s ideas surrounding Bitcoin are centered around his belief in decentralization as a good. Bitcoin is a reasonably decentralized system. Its founder is out of the picture, it is owned by no single entity, and its community has managed to keep working on the project despite it lacking a traditional leader or external investment. How does that contrast with web3, the blockchain projects that also trumpet the power and importance of decentralization? Dorsey thinks that web3 is, in fact, centralized due to ownership — control — accruing in the hands of external investors, a16z among them. This is because, unlike with Bitcoin, web3 companies are busy hoovering up venture capital at a rate that is frankly staggering, meaning that many decentralized projects are racking up large external investors in their central holding companies — centralization squared, I suppose. Dorsey’s complaints about ownership, web3, and the role of external capital in funding so much of the crypto market came to a head in a series of tweets posted between December 20 and 22, with the well-known Twitter user taking potshots at venture capital in crypto more generally, and a16z in particular. One example for flavor: You don’t own “web3.” The VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives. It’s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label. Know what you’re getting into… — jack (@jack) December 21, 2021 Them’s fighting words. So what happened most recently? Well, a16z denizen and prolific Twitter blocker Chris Dixon took a shot back at Dorsey’s argument yesterday with the following:","['Cryptocurrency', 'Fundings & Exits', 'Startups', 'Andreessen Horowitz', 'Bitcoin', 'blockchains', 'Chris Dixon', 'decentralization', 'jack dorsey', 'Marc Andreessen', 'Twitter', 'Web 2.0', 'web3']",https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/your-mom-owns-web-2-0/,,techcrunch

134,The 101 most stunning women's sports photos of 2021,2022-01-03,Insider spoke with several Getty Images sports photographers about capturing the most stunning shots in women's sports over the course of the year.,"Serena Williams prepares for a point during her Australian Open semifinal match against Naomi Osaka.Cameron Spencer/Getty ImagesSports rebounded from the punishing COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, allowing women's sports leagues, teams, and athletes to enjoy one of their most successful and memorable to date.Between Naomi Osaka's run-in with a butterfly at the Australian Open en route to her fourth career Grand Slam title, Simone Biles' heroics at the Tokyo Olympics, a riveting and star-studded 2021 WNBA Finals series, and national championship games across several college sports, there was no shortage of excitement in the world of women's sports.Getty Images captured it all, so Insider spoke with several of the brand's top sports photographers about how they captured some of the most stunning shots in women's sports throughout the year.Here are 101 of the most striking women's sports photos of 2021:JanuaryBrad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images1/10: Lara Gut-behrami of Switzerland competes at the Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Women's Super Giant Slalom in St. Anton, Austria.Christophe Pallot/Agence Zoom/Getty Images1/14: Lindsay Thorngren competes at the US Figure Skating Championships.Tim Nwachukwu/Getty Images1/17: Chelsea's Fran Kirby celebrates scoring a goal against Manchester United during a Barclays FA Women's Super League match.Justin Setterfield/Getty Images1/22: Wang Han and Shi Tingmao of China practice in the Women's 3m Synchro Springboard during 2021 China Diving Olympic Trials in Wuhan, China.Lintao Zhang/Getty Images1/30: Nikola Zdrahalova of Czech Republic competes in the 1500m Ladies race during the ISU World Cup Speed Skating in Heerenveen, Netherlands.Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images1/31: Barcelona's Alexia Putellas celebrates her team's goal against rival Real Madrid.Pedro Salado/Quality Sport Images/Getty ImagesFebruarySam Barnes/Sportsfile via Getty Images2/6: Danielle Scott of Australia completes a training run for the Woman's Aerial Finals at the 2021 Intermountain Healthcare Freestyle International Ski World Cup in Park City, Utah.Gregory Shamus/Getty Images2/11: Kenyan skier Sabrina Simader smiles after completing her run in the Women's Super-G during the FIS World Ski Championships Women's Super Giant Slalom in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images2/12: Naomi Osaka watches as a butterfly flutters over her racket during the third round of the Australian Open.Daniel Pockett/Getty Images2/18: Serena Williams prepares for a point during her Australian Open semifinal match against Naomi Osaka.Serena Williams prepares for a point during her Australian Open semifinal match against Naomi Osaka.Cameron Spencer/Getty Images2/26: Nelly Korda tees off during the second round of the Gainbridge LPGA at Lake Nona Golf and Country Club in Orlando, Florida.Julio Aguilar/Getty ImagesMarchJoosep Martinson - International Skating Union/International Skating Union via Getty Images3/1: Ursa Bogataj of Slovenia jumps during the Women Large Hill Individual training session at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Oberstdorf, Germany.Matthias Hangst/Getty Images3/5: Runners begin the 3000 meters at the European Athletics Indoor Championships in Torun, Poland.Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images for European Athletics3/10: Jamie Anderson competes in the women's snowboard slopestyle qualifications during the Aspen 2021 FIS Snowboard and Freeski World Championship.Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Ezra Shaw:The Snowboard and Freeski World Championships were moved from China to Aspen last spring due to Covid-19, so it was an event that I wasn't expecting to photograph when the year began. I really enjoy shooting both sports so I was very happy to head to Aspen for the Championships.The reason that I like shooting slopestyle is because you have to ski the course to find a good picture. On this day, it had snowed the night before, so I wanted to show the snow in the background. I was able to find a nice spot of the top athlete from the United States, Jamie Anderson, as she competed on the rail section of the course with the snowy pine trees in the background.3/10: Eileen Gu competes in the women's freeski halfpipe qualifications during the Aspen 2021 FIS Snowboard and Freeski World Championship.Sean M. Haffey/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Sean M. Haffey:With the Beijing Olympics right around the corner, there has been a lot of attention on the new skiing phenom Eileen Gu. In this photo, I watched her warmup prior to her first run on the halfpipe and determined where I should be in order to make the highest impact photo of her.Gu seems to go higher and farther than the other competitors. On the halfpipe, you really need to get on shot of the athlete before they are out of range, so positioning was crucial. On this run, she hit the lip of the pipe switch and I was able to capture the moment. Gu is a tremendous athlete and great ambassador for the sport.3/27: Aari McDonald celebrates her Arizona Wildcats defeating the Texas A&M Aggies in the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament in San Antonio, Texas.Carmen Mandato/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Carmen Mandato:Aari McDonald of the Arizona Wildcats had one of the most dominant performances of the entire tournament. In watching McDonald from the beginning, I could see her energy level respond to not just her own points, but the flow of the game. I could see the team getting behind her scoring, defensive efforts and overall energy. It was important for me to not just get her isolated reactions, but to have her in the foreground ahead of her teammates to tell a fuller story. I followed McDonald after a particular strong few possession from Arizona during the game against Texas A&M and this was the resulting image.3/27: Japanese golfer Hinako Shibuno hits a tee shot at the AXA Ladies Golf Tournament in Miyazaki, Japan.Atsushi Tomura/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Atsushi Tomura:I shot this photo of Hinako Shibuno during the AXA Ladies Golf tournament held at UMK Country Club in Miyazaki, Japan. Hinako started her career with stunning result in 2019, wining the AIG Women's British open and four wins in the LPGA of Japan tour. She became the second Japanese golfer to win overseas major tournament and first in 42 years.At UMK Country Club this year, cherry blossoms that only bloom for a few weeks of the year were in bloom. At the 16th hole, I took a position so that the cherry blossoms would come in the background of the player. One good thing about shooting golf is that the pictures taken at the same place change constantly depending on the season, time, weather, etc. 3/27: Iowa Hawkeyes star Caitlin Clark puts up a shot against the UConn Huskies during their Sweet Sixteen matchup.Carmen Mandato/Getty Images3/29: UConn Huskies star Paige Bueckers celebrates draining a three pointer against the Baylor Bears during the Elite Eight of the 2021 NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament in San Antonio, Texas.Elsa/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Elsa Garrison:UConn Freshman Paige Bueckers made her presence known during this tournament. The freshman guard was recently named the winner of the John R. Wooden Award honoring college basketball's most outstanding player. She is the first freshman woman to win that award.In this image, she had just sunk a three-point shot against Baylor in a hard fought game that came down to the wire. UConn won the game to advance to the Final Four only to lose to Arizona in the semifinal round. What I like about this image is the fire and competitiveness that she exhibited throughout the tournament.3/29: Aari McDonald and Arizona Wildcats head coach Adia Barnes react to getting covered with confetti after their win over the Indiana Hoosiers during the Elite Eight of the 2021 NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament.Elsa/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Elsa Garrison:Due to COVID restrictions, the NCAA Women's Basketball tournament was played in a bubble in San Antonio. Instead of the normal stage and confetti canons that are traditionally at this event, a cooler was filled with confetti for teams to use as they wished. As guard Aari McDonald and head coach Adia Barnes of the Arizona Wildcats were being interviewed after their win over the Indiana Hoosiers, Wildcat teammates dumped the bucket of confetti on them.This image is from just before the moment of impact. I saw the team moving in on the pair and positioned myself to where I could see the reaction on their faces as they were showered. I really liked this moment because you can see they are both realizing what is coming their way before being buried in confetti. This season was a historic run for the Wildcats and this picture helps tell that story as they make their first Final Four appearance ever.AprilClive Brunskill/Getty Image4/4: Arizona Wildcats guard Aari McDonald (left) steals the ball from Stanford Cardinal point guard Kiana Williams during the 2021 national championship game.Elsa/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Elsa Garrison:This championship game was an intense battle – especially in the fourth quarter. Both teams were playing tough defense and Aari McDonald of the Arizona Wildcats saw an opportunity to try and make the steal from Kianna Williams of the Stanford Cardinal. McDonald knocked the ball loose, but Williams was quick to grab it again and the two fought intensely for possession.Stanford won the national title by one point. Throughout the game, these two were relentless in their defense and had intense drive in their offense. I think this is picture captures that and the battle between both teams to the very end.4/4: A dejected Aari McDonald (left) sits on the court after missing a last second shot that allowed the Stanford Cardinal to win in the 2021 national championship over the Arizona Wildcats.Elsa/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Elsa Garrison:When covering a final, I try to find different ways and different angles to tell the story of the game. I find it best when you can see both sides in one frame. For this image, I set up a remote camera in the catwalk the day before the Women's Championship game. I anticipated that the celebration would be somewhere around center court. After Aari McDonald of Arizona took her last shot within the final second of the game, she fell backwards near the Final Four logo as the Stanford team celebrated. This is an easy image to read. The center court logo is stark and catches the eye automatically. In the right corner, the Stanford team celebrates in pure joy as they pile on the floor in total excitement, whereas in the left corner, the sadness of Aari McDonald's body language is just devastating as she reacts to the loss. Placing a remote camera does not always guarantee success, but it gives me the opportunity to be in two places at once and capture an image like this from above.4/9: Japanese golfer Rena Ishikawa hits her second shot during the Fujiflim Studio Alice Ladies Open in Miki, Hyogo, Japan.Atsushi Tomura/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Atsushi Tomura:The start of round one of the Fujiflim Studio Alice Ladies Open was significantly delayed due to rain. Rookie Rena Ishikawa started at 2:30pm from the in-course. It was dusk when I came to the 2nd hole in this photo.Since I've been shooting this course for several years, I remembered that there is a spot with a clean view of the sky from behind on the 2nd hole. Soon after it was decided that the match would continue until sunset, I made my way to this spot when the sky was perfectly clear.4/10: Kathleen Baker competes in the Women's 200 Meter IM Heats at the TYR Pro Swim Series at Mission Viejo.Maddie Meyer/Getty Images4/11: Katie Ledecky passes an opponent in the opposite direction during the Women's 1500 Meter Freestyle Final of the TYR Pro Swim Series at Mission Viejo.Maddie Meyer/Getty Images4/13: Megan Rapinoe (left) shoots against French goalie Pauline Peyraud Magnin during a friendly match in Le Havre, France.Catherine Steenkeste/Getty Images4/17: Janja Garnbret of Slovenia competes in the women's finals of the IFSC Climbing World Cup in Meiringen, Switzerland.Marco Kost/Getty ImagesMayMatt Dunbar/World Surf League via Getty Images5/5: Jun Hoong Cheong of Malaysia competes in the Women's 10m Platform semifinal of the FINA Diving World Cup in Tokyo, Japan.Toru Hanai/Getty Images5/8: Juventus players throw head coach Rita Guarino into the air after the team secured its fourth Serie A title in four years.Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images5/28: Karen Tsuruoka of Japan hits her second shot during the first round of the Resorttrust Ladies in Toyota, Aichi, Japan.Atsushi Tomura/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Atsushi Tomura:The JLPGA tour Resorttrust Ladies 2021 was held at St. Creek Golf Club on a beautiful spring day. This photo is of Karen Tsuruoka's second shot on the 6th hole. She missed a tee shot to the right, but it was a perfect photograph.I shot the player surrounded by the bunker with a 400mm telephoto lens. Due to COVID-19, the JLPGA tour in the first half of this season continued to be no gallery. Because of that, the roping for the gallery and the stand for the TV were less obstructive, and it was much easier to find a beautiful background like this one.5/28: Misuzu Narita of Japan celebrates after making an eagle during the second round of the Resorttrust Ladies in Toyota, Aichi, Japan.Atsushi Tomura/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Atsushi Tomura:This photo is of Misuzu Narita who was pleased to put the second shot directly into the cup at the 9th hole par 4 near sunset. On the second day of the Resorttrust Ladies, the start was delayed by three hours due to heavy rain from the morning. The color of the clouds changed every minute here as sunset approached. It is quite rare to play in a golf tournament when it's this dark, so I was desperate to shoot the players with this beautifully lit sky and clouds.When Narita arrived at this spot, the pin flag was so dark that I could hardly see it. Knowing that this was my last chance, I approached her from about two-meters, crawled on the grass and looked up with a short zoom lens. I was convinced that any action would be a great photo with this beautiful background. As a result, her second shot was a cup-in. This was a moment her performance went beyond my expectations and imagination.5/30: Boston College's Charlotte North celebrates scoring her 100th goal of the season during the 2021 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship in Towson, Maryland.Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Patrick Smith:I was excited to photograph the 2021 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship with it being so close to home. Championships always produce high-emotion imagery and I went into the game hoping to document a visually telling image.Charlotte North of the Boston College Eagles provided that not only once, but five other times, as she scored a total of six goals. Her incredible efforts led the Eagles to defeating the Syracuse Orange for their program's first ever title. North also broke the most goals in a single season during the game which also was quite historic.JuneJamie Squire/Getty Images6/4: Simone Biles completes a Yurchenko double pike vault.Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Jamie Squire:Simone Biles had just made history at the event just prior to this competition by landing a Yurchenko double pike vault. As one of the marquee athletes set to compete at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, I knew I wanted to find a unique angle to show her competing on the apparatus. While it's nearly impossible to show what makes a Yurchenko double pike vault a Yurchenko double pike vault in still pictures, I attempted to show the crazy amount of height Biles gets by shooting with a wide angle lens just to the side of the podium. The level of difficulty she achieves really does set her apart from the competition. Biles is so much fun to watch and to photograph as she continues to make history and break records.6/6: Yuka Saso of the Philippines celebrates with the Harton S. Semple Trophy after winning the US Women's Open Championship.Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Ezra Shaw: This picture happened at the end of a long day during the US Women's Open final round, and candidly I never thought it would happen. Yuka Saso started off the day horribly, with a double bogey on the second and third holes. She fell quite a few shots behind leader Lexi Thompson. However, Saso was able to keep her composure and finished the day strong with two birdies on the final three holes, while Thompson faltered and shot a +5 on the back nine. Saso overtook Thompson and forced a playoff with Nasa Hataoka, which she won on the third hole. This picture came close to the end of the trophy presentation. It was a nice moment when Saso turned towards the sun and raised the trophy into the air. The sun highlighted her face while she was looking up at the trophy.6/19: Sha'Carri Richardson celebrates winning the 100-meter final US Olympic Track & Field Team Trials.Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Patrick Smith:During the US Olympic Track & Field Team Trials, we not only witnessed a newly redesigned Hayward Field, we also witnessed some changing of the guard with regards to the athletes. As the next wave of US Olympic Track & Field stars come to the forefront — some are shining brighter — one being Women's 100 Meter star Sha'Carri Richardson. Richardson comfortably led the field in every heat and brought excitement that sports photographers love which included — passion, personality, and perfectionism. When she dominated the Women's 100 Meter final her uniqueness was on full display as she stuck out her tongue and celebrated. My shooting position and assignment was to focus on her post-finish line emotion in turn one. Taking a gamble and being the furthest photographer to the outside — we were thrilled as a team when we knew we would be able to show the world her elation. Outrunning her competitors in one of the biggest races of her life qualified her for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.6/20: Simone Manuel reacts to punching her ticket to the Tokyo Olympics after winning the 50m Freestyle final at US Olympic Team Swimming Trials.Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Maddie Meyer:I made this the last day of US Olympic Team Swimming Trials in Omaha, during the 50m Freestyle final. All eyes were on Simone Manuel after she failed to qualify in the 100m Freestyle, an event she had won in Rio. This race was her last chance to make the Olympic team. She had spoken earlier in the week about being diagnosed with Overtraining Syndrome, which had plagued her with fatigue, elevated heart rate, and depression while training this year.The 50m is the shortest race, the athletes are churning through the water so quickly you don't have a chance to see their faces until they touch the wall at the end of the event. I kept my eye on the scoreboard and the moment I saw she had won, I found Manuel and waited to see her reaction. A huge sense of relief seemed to flood over her as she fell back and covered her face.6/20: Allyson Felix celebrates with her daughter, Camryn, after finishing second in the 400-meter Final to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.Steph Chambers/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Steph Chambers:Allyson Felix qualified for her fifth Olympics, and first as a mother, after finishing second in the 400 Meter final at the US Olympic Track & Field Team Trials. Felix, who is one of the most decorated track athletes in history, had announced that this summer's games in Tokyo will be her final. With this dramatic backstory, Felix brought her daughter on the track as she caught her breath and soaked in this moment together.What I am drawn to most as a photographer is raw emotion. The beauty of sport is that it mirrors life — celebration, dejection, tenderness with family and moments of self-reflection — all in a one-lap race, in Felix's case. For me, seeing this star sit down on her child's level conveys the dedication to her family and how she's competing with her family legacy in mind.JulyYuichi Masuda/Getty Images7/2: Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson leaps for a shot against Lauren Cox of the Los Angeles Sparks.Meg Oliphant/Getty Images7/10: Ashleigh Barty celebrates defeating Karolina Pliskova to win the 2021 Wimbledon women's singles title.Julian Finney/Getty Images7/16: Sylvia Fowles (center) pulls in a rebound against Australia's Ezi Magbegor (left) and Katie Ebzery during a pre-Olympics exhibition game between the US and Australia.Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Ethan Miller:The USA Basketball men's and women's national teams held practices and exhibition games in Las Vegas as they got ready for the Olympic Games in Tokyo. Because of pandemic protocols, media was not allowed to be near players, so there was no access to the court, and that meant no chance to set up remote cameras on the baskets.I photographed the game from about halfway up in the stands with a long lens, using a cable to trigger the backboard camera remotely. In the second half, Chelsea Gray of the U.S. put up a shot that hit the rim. Before Gray even released the ball, Sylvia Fowles — the two-time WNBA champion and Finals MVP from the Minnesota Lynx who also holds the WNBA record for rebounds per game average — boxed out Australia's Ezi Magbegor to secure the rebound in front of her and Katie Ebzery.Despite getting hit on the hand and head by Magbegor, Fowles went right back up and banked a left-handed shot in for a score. Because Gray's shot bounced high off the rim, I held the trigger down for longer than usual on the remote to try to capture an image with all the players looking up at the ball (and my camera). This is one of the only images where all three players' faces are visible. The ball covering just the top of Fowles' head in the photo intensifies the determined look in her eyes just as she gets both hands on the rebound. 7/21: Christen Press looks dejected after her USWNT concedes a third goal to Sweden during the women's first round group match at the Tokyo Olympics.Dan Mullan/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Dan Mullan:This image was less about action and more about emotions. After Sweden scored their third goal, you could see the body language of the USA athletes drop. I was able to isolate Christen Press as she walked back to the halfway line as Sweden celebrated behind her. The empty seats also make it feel even more isolated. It was a night to forget for the United States team but they bounced back later in the tournament.7/25: Zofia Noceti Klepacka of Team Poland in action during the third Women's RS-X Class race at the Tokyo Olympics.Clive Mason/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Clive Mason:This photograph was taken on day two of the Olympic Games. It wasn't the breeziest of days meaning the competitors had to work hard upwind, and pumping the sail was the way that they could get enough momentum to race.I remember this sequence because Zofia Noceti Klepacka took a slightly different line to the others — it was clear, unobstructed and among the bokeh of the back lit glinting water. She was working so, so hard and was pumping her sail for what seemed like ages. I loved the way her silhouette changed shape with every frame I took, as did her pony tailed hair, all illustrating how much effort that was going into her race.7/26: Margielyn Didal of Team Philippines celebrates during the women's street final of the Tokyo Olympics.Patrick Smith / Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Patrick Smith:This image is of Margielyn Didal of Team Philippines as she celebrated during the Women's Street Final. With skateboarding as a new sport at this year's Olympics, I wanted to capture not only the action, but emotion that comes along with it as well.While Didal didn't medal, she had a great spirit despite taking some hard falls during the competition. As she acknowledged the others in the final, Didal shot a big smile and flexed her arm, showcasing her creative COVID-19/ Tokyo 2020 Olympics tattoo.7/26: Australia's Ariarne Titmus (left) and American Katie Ledecky react after finishing first and second, respectively, in the Women's 400m Freestyle Final at the Tokyo Olympics.Al Bello/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Al Bello:The Olympic Games give us some of the greatest reactions from athletes in sports, so after Ledecky was upset in her loss to Ariarne Titmus and finished second in the 400 meter freestyle final, I kept my camera on her to capture any emotion she showed. Although she finished in second place, Ledecky appeared to still be in great spirits and immediately congratulated Titmus with a smile on her face. It was an honor to cover these two incredible athletes.7/27: American surfer Carissa Moore waits for a set as a rainbow appears during the women's gold medal match at the Tokyo Olympics.Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Ryan Pierse:Conditions were tough throughout the surfing competition, with high cross winds and muddy light, but the big swell did eventuate for the last few days. Just as I thought I had taken my last picture of the event, a rainbow appeared out of nowhere in the last minute of the women's Gold medal match.In this photo, Carissa Moore of Team USA is floating on her board taking it all in, and already knew she had secured the gold medal. This picture feels both literal and figurative, like the ""pot of gold"" right at the end of a tough but enjoyable week as surfing made its Olympic debut in Tokyo.7/27: Japan's Mima Ito serves the ball during her Women's Singles Round of 16 match on day four of the Tokyo Olympics.Steph Chambers/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Steph Chambers:Sports roared back from stifling COVID-19 protocols in nearly full swing, except for the Tokyo Olympics. There were no fans allowed, mandatory quarantines placed, and access was limited within venues. In these instances, that's when a photographer's creativity is truly tested.My assignment for the Olympics was to cover the table tennis competition. My personal goal going into this was thinking about how I visually show that this sport and its athletes are just as competitive, beautiful and uniquely skilled as the marquee, primetime events. Intimacy of high stakes sport is defined in the details through drops of sweat, snow from ice skates, and, in this case, the Tokyo 2020 ball lifting off a player's fingertips.I spent several sessions photographing Mima Ito's signature serve with a 400mm lens while lying on the ground. She didn't always serve in this way, which made it more of a challenge to capture and decide how much time to spend achieving this image I envisioned.7/29: Zoe Claessens of Team Switzerland, Vineta Petersone of Team Latvia, Manon Valentino of Team France, Bethany Shriever of Team Great Britain, Saya Sakakibara of Team Australia, and Lauren Reynolds of Team Australia jump during the Women's BMX quaterfinal heat of the Tokyo Olympics.Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Ezra Shaw:My assigned venue for the Tokyo Olympics has been at the Ariake Urban Sports Park. It's a pretty cool venue because it has all the BMX and skateboarding events – both new sports making their Olympic debut this year.This picture was taken during the first day of the BMX racing. I had checked out the course earlier in the week and thought that shooting from the stands would make for a really nice picture.To get this image, I used a special tilt-shift lens that changes the focal plane of the lens to give the effect of everything out of focus in the foreground and background. It took quite a few different races before I was able to get one that was focused on the heads of the racers and where the racers were all lined in a row like this.7/29: American Suni Lee poses with her gold medal from the women's gymnastics individual all-around event.Laurence Griffiths/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Laurence Griffiths:I love sporting trophies and medals, particularly Olympic Gold Medals. During this shoot after the completion of the Women's All-Around Final, I asked All-Around Champion Suni Lee to hold her gold medal in front of her face so I could focus on the detail of the medal and on her amazing finger nails with the Olympic rings.The combination of the medal and nail details with Lee's bright smile and sparkling uniform in the background was a picture-perfect moment to honor and celebrate her incredible achievement.7/31: Olga Nikitina (Bottom) and Sofia Pozdniakova of team ROC celebrate winning the Women's Sabre Team Fencing gold medal match at the Tokyo Olympics.Elsa/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Elsa Garrison:This image was taken during the Women's Sabre Team Fencing gold medal match between Team ROC and France. I used a remote camera that was installed in the trusses above the final piste. I had shot several matches before I got an image that finally worked and this one was it!I knew when Team ROC fell to the ground that I had a chance to capture the moment from above. I triggered this camera at the same time that I was using my hand held camera. I use remote cameras as a way to be in two places at once. It gives me multiple angles on a moment that can be used to tell the story of a game or match. They don't always work out, but when they do, they are really tremendous.AugustAl Bello/Getty Images8/2: US soccer star Carli Lloyd holds her head in her hands following the USWNT's loss to Canada in the Tokyo Olympics semifinal.Francois Nel/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Francois Nel:The match between USA and Canada was always going to be tough and with it being a semi-final, both teams had to win which made for a great match with everything on the line. I knew if Team Canada would win there would be big celebrations but also dejection from Team USA. I noticed Canadian players running past Carli Lloyd and decided to focus on her to show the levity of the moment and tell the story of disappointment and excitement in one image.8/2: Sydney McLaughlin of the US competes in the Women's 400 meter hurdles semifinals at the Tokyo Olympics.Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Ryan Pierse:Sydney McLaughlin just looks like a winner. The way she glides effortlessly over the hurdles, the American athlete is a joy to photograph. Just before the Women's 400m Hurdles Semifinal in Tokyo, a heavy rain shower sat over the Olympic Stadium drenching the track.She didn't let it stop her, beating the rest of the field by over a second despite the slippery conditions. McLaughlin went on two days later to claim gold in the Final.8/3: American wrestler Tamyra Mensah-Stock celebrates her gold-medal victory at the Tokyo Olympics.Tom Pennington/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Tom Pennington:This image of Tamyra Mariama Mensah-Stock of Team USA was captured after she won the Women's Freestyle 68kg Gold Medal Match. Immediately after she was declared the official winner of the match, Mensah-Stock circled the wrestling mat hoisting the American flag overhead while celebrating. She was overcome with so much emotion and pointed overhead. I was anticipating some type of intense reaction from the Gold Medal Match, so I had positioned myself where I could shoot into a clean, uncluttered background hoping to isolate the winner. Everything came together to create a powerful photo of Mensah-Stock's historical win.8/3: Simone Biles smiles before starting her balance beam routine at the Tokyo Olympics.Laurence Griffiths/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Laurence Griffiths:This image of Simone Biles was captured at the start of her bronze-medal winning routine as she presented to the judges. I think this sums up her bravery in that moment. I can't imagine how she was feeling at that exact time with the weight of the world on her shoulders. I was blown away by her incredible courage, as well as her incredible smile in this photo. Biles is a true legend to photograph, not only for her astounding ability, but because of all the gymnasts and people she inspires.8/5: Team USA's Kristie Mewis comforts Australian star Sam Kerr following the USWNT's bronze-medal victory over the Matildas.Francois Nel/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Francois Nel:It is always great to see when players from opposite teams come together after a match. Australia versus United States was always going to be a high energy match and both teams playing for pride and their countries to win the bronze medal. I was hoping there would be moments where the players would come together, and I noticed Kristie Mewis of Team USA walking over to Sam Kerr of Team Australia after the match. It was good to see the players embracing each other and showing true sportsmanship.8/7: Dutch runner Sifan Hassan chases an opponent in the 10,000m final at the Tokyo Olympics.Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Matthias Hangst:It was the last day of the Athletics competition in Tokyo and I was assigned to cover the medals ceremonies and had a roaming position on the tribune. After 14 days of competition, it was really hard at that point to find something different because our team of photographers had already done a great job finding the best angles and spots during this time.This frame is shot using a reflection of a glass hygiene barrier of a TV crew around 30m away from the track. I like it because it shows one of the dominating athletes Sifan Hassan of Team Netherlands competing in the Women's 10,000m Final. She was photographed so often during the Games, but I think this perspective is very unique.8/8: USA Basketball players pose with their gold medals after beating Team Japan in the Tokyo Olympics.Abbie Parr/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Abbie Parr:In this photo, the Team USA women's basketball team was celebrating their win over Team Japan after the gold medal match. I loved photographing this team because even though they all compete against each other in the WNBA, anyone from an outside perspective can easily see how much respect these women have for each other and how well they come together as a team. Living in Seattle, I am beyond spoiled being able to cover the WNBA defending champions, the Seattle Storm, so to see locals Sue Bird, Breanna Stewart, and Jewell Lloyd win gold for our country was incredibly special.8/21: Cece Kizer and Sinclaire Miramontez carry the winner's trophy after Racing Louisville won The Women's Cup Championship in front of their home crowd at Lynn Family Stadium.Tim Nwachukwu/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Tim Nwachukwu:This was an exhibition tournament and yet every team played as if the Champions League was on the line. Among the four teams participating, Racing Louisville would've been considered the underdog based on their NWSL record and short history. It's pretty rare that the hosts win the tournament, so being able to photograph the players taking a lap around the pitch with the trophy to celebrate with fans was my way of explaining how impactful that moment was to the club and community.SeptemberRomina Amato/Red Bull via Getty Images9/3: Kumudu P. Dissanayake Mudiyanselage of Sri Lanka competes in the long jump at the Paralympics in Tokyo.Carmen Mandato/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Carmen Mandato:The long jump offers beautiful imagery of the athletes' midair. An editor of mine noted that the landing better captured the strength and intensity of the jumper. The hope in focusing on the landing was to draw attention to the power being harnessed by the jumper.You can see from her expression and the direction of the sand, the force in which she lands with. This for me is often one of the main things I'm looking for in action coverage, isolating a moment to better show the power harnessed that would otherwise be lost to the eye when viewing the sequence.9/3: American Elizabeth Marks tears up after winning gold in the 100m Backstroke at the Tokyo Paralympics.Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Alex Pantling:Being lucky enough to be so up close and personal during the medal ceremonies, I really got to appreciate how much a medal of any color meant to each individual athlete. There are so many athletes competing in the Paralympics that most don't medal, so those that do you can really feel their emotion as they are recognized and honored on the podium. I think that this shows here.9/3: Naomi Osaka screams in frustration during a US Open match.Elsa/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Elsa Garrison:Naomi Osaka had been struggling her last few matches. She had a rough outing at the Tokyo Olympics and that carried over into the U.S. Open. I find that reaction images are just as telling as an action image. Osaka and Leylah Fernandez were in a tiebreak when Osaka lost this point. She ended up losing the match to the surging Fernandez. I thought this picture illustrates her frustration perfectly.9/6: Team Europe stars Matilda Castren and Madelene Sagstrom celebrate with the Solheim Cup after beating Team USA in the event.Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Maddie Meyer:Here, Matilda Castren and Madelene Sagstrom celebrate Team Europe's victory over the United States in the Solheim Cup. The event was a first for me, I was new to covering match play golf which pits countries against each other. The Europeans played well all weekend, maintaining a steady lead and getting it done in the end.They were reserved on the course, surrounded overwhelmingly by American fans who were hopeful for a home team win. After the trophy ceremony they really gave it up! Draped in their countries' flags and being showered in champagne, the reigning champions held onto the Solheim Cup for another year.9/9: Leylah Fernandez reacts to advancing to the 2021 US Open championship match.Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Sarah Stier:Leylah Annie Fernandez was having a fairytale tournament run and when she defeated a powerful Aryna Sabalenka to advance to the US Open Finals, I knew she would react. At 19 years old, this was going to be her first final.Many players that I've photographed who have consistently reached finals or semifinals won't typically react as big since they aren't as surprised by it. But with Fernandez, this was a career-changing moment for her, and my side-on angle captured it perfectly. It was a great moment for Canadian tennis and was an incredible achievement to witness and capture.9/11: Emma Raducanu becomes emotional upon winning the US Open title — her first career Grand Slam championship.Elsa/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Elsa Garrison:Emma Raducanu of Great Britain was a qualifier. That means she had to win 3 matches just to qualify for the U.S Open draw. To reach the finals, she had to then win 6 more matches. This image was from match point after she defeated Leylah Fernandez to win the U.S. Open singles title.During qualifying and the tournament, she never lost a set, which is pretty remarkable. This image shows how overcome with emotion she was after winning, almost like she couldn't believe it and makes you feel proud of all that she had accomplished.9/12: Los Angeles Sparks guard Erica Wheeler sends Seattle Storm point guard Sue Bird stumbling with a crossover.Meg Oliphant/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Meg Oliphant:I covered the majority of the LA Sparks' season in the next-door Convention Center with a makeshift setup and during Covid-19 protocols that didn't allow me to photograph from the floor, so it was great getting back courtside at Staples Center. The intensity of the game is so high from the floor, making for photos that put the viewer in the middle of the action.The Sparks were pushing for a postseason spot and I knew the game against Seattle would be intense. I was keeping an eye on legendary Sue Bird, and Erica Wheeler had a great game, scoring 17-points this game to help the Sparks win. She's a really tough player and I love getting to capture the speed and agility these players bring to every play.9/21: Sophia Smith (left) of the USWNT celebrates her first career international goal as Paraguay's Tania Riso grimaces.Emilee Chinn/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Emilee Chinn:This photo shows the raw and unfiltered emotions of athletes, both the positive and the negative aspect. Sophia Smith of the United States, on the left, was celebrating her first career international goal which was a big and exciting moment for her. Tania Riso of Paraguay, on the right, is reacting to the United States scoring their second goal in under six minutes in the first half of the game.To me, this image is really impactful because you can visually see the emotion and heart these athletes put into their game and how it affects them. It directly depicts ""competition"" showing the highs and the lows.9/23: The Phoenix Mercury's Sophie Cunningham celebrates draining a three-pointer during a single-elimination WNBA playoff game against the New York Liberty.Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Christian Petersen:I always love shooting basketball, especially now that photographers are allowed back on the court. But, when it's WNBA and playoff action it's even more exciting. These athletes battle so hard for every pass, every shot and every point.Sophie Cunningham of the Phoenix Mercury was having a good game. She hit a three-point shot at the timeliest moment and just let her emotion go. Thankfully, I had a perfect angle to capture her celebration with a clean background.The Mercury held the lead and eventually won the game. Cunningham was awarded player of the game and gave a few words after. It's games and moments like this that we as sports photographers look for.OctoberSarah Stier/Getty Images10/6: Carli Lloyd's NJ/NY Gotham FC teammates pour a sports drink on her after their match against the Washington Spirit at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania.Mitchell Leff/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Mitchell Leff:I was honored to be given the assignment to cover Carli Lloyd during her hometown farewell match at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania. I knew I wanted to get a tight frame of her post game and just waited until that moment happened. This image is of Lloyd reacting after her teammates doused her with a sports drink following her post-game ceremony.10/8: Shey Peddy celebrates as her Phoenix Mercury books a trip to the 2021 WNBA Finals after defeating the Las Vegas Aces in Game Five of the semifinals at Michelob ULTRA Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Ethan Miller:The deciding Game 5 of the WNBA semifinals between the Phoenix Mercury and the Las Vegas Aces was an intense back-and-forth game in front of a record Vegas crowd. Phoenix has three All-star/US Olympians on the team — Diana Taurasi, Brittney Griner and Skylar Diggins-Smith, but I had heard previously about Shey Peddy from a family member.Although a less well-known player, she has become a fan favorite in Phoenix, both because of her skills and her long road to becoming a WNBA player. Her teammates refer to her as ""Playoff P"" for her hustle on the court and being a great teammate.With the score tied at 84, Peddy grabbed a loose ball and got fouled as she put up a falling 3-pointer with less than five seconds on the clock. After missing the first free throw, she hit the next two and then helped double-team the Aces' A'ja Wilson, who got blocked on a layup attempt by Griner to secure the Mercury's 87-84 victory, sending them to the WNBA Finals.After the block, Peddy jumped in the air four times, but a referee was in the way, preventing me from getting a photo. As the final few seconds ticked off the clock, I zeroed in on Peddy as she turned toward her bench, hoping to get a reaction and got this great expression as she leaned back and shouted in celebration before all the Phoenix players ran onto the court.10/9: American tennis star Cori ""Coco"" Gauff plays a forehand against Caroline Garcia of France during their second-round match of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Clive Brunskill:Cori Gauff is what we tennis photographers call the magic light. Gauff was playing at late afternoon in her second round match. I knew from experience that even though the lighting in October is slightly different to March when the tournament in Indian Wells is normally held, that Coco would play past 4:20pm when the court goes completely into the shade.At around 4:05 p.m. the sunlight was disappearing so fast that I had a maximum 10-minute window to shoot this type of striking light. The thing is a player can play 10-minutes without ever running through the last embers of the winter desert sun.Luckily for me, Gauff played two forehands which gave me a lot of different frames due to the super high speed motor drives on today's cameras. I just love the concentration in her eyes which the low, late afternoon sun picks out perfectly!10/13: Diana Taurasi high-fives fans after Phoenix Mercury's overtime victory in Game 2 of the 2021 WNBA Finals.Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Christian Petersen:Capturing the emotion of the athletes following a victory is always a priority. I especially love to get up close and use wider lens to capture the player and fans. In this image, you can see Diana Taurasi leaving the court after a big win, with a smile from ear-to-ear.10/17: Candace Parker celebrates after bringing a WNBA title to her hometown Chicago Sky.Stacy Revere/Candace ParkerFrom the photographer, Stacy Revere:Candace Parker is a legend in sport — she's also a native of Chicago, so the opportunity to photograph her, in Chicago, playing against Diana Taurasi, for the WNBA Finals was an amazing opportunity.As time expired and the Chicago Sky became champions, the court was suddenly filled with players, coaches, media, family and friends. The story was Candace Parker so staying with her was the main goal, and as the team surrounded her, I happened to be in a good spot to capture this wonderful moment.I can see the joy from Parker and the appreciation from her teammates — a truly surreal moment and one of my favorites as a photographer.10/24: American Audrey Shin performs in the Exhibition Program during the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating - Skate America at Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Jamie Squire:After every competitive figure skating event, the organizers hold an exhibition event. This is a time where skaters can skate freely to music and routines that they pick to showcase their talents purely for fans' entertainment. Typically, they dim the lights and use spotlights to create a much more dramatic effect. It's basically a show at the end of the competition.This image was captured during that show. I knew that the spotlights would be on, so I decided to go up into the stands of the arena to capture the action. The result is a much more dramatic image than I could have made at ice level because one can see the spotlights and the shadows of the skater, as well as areas of light and shadow.10/26: Carli Lloyd, wearing a jersey with her husband's surname on the back, waves to fans after her final game as a member of the US Women's National TeamDavid Berding/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, David Berding:This was taken after the USWNT game against South Korea had ended. Members of the team did a lap around the field to wave to fans and thank them for coming. When Carli Lloyd came around, I kept my camera on her as she waved and saw that she was wearing a jersey with her husband's last name on it.On a personal level, I thought it was quite touching that she'd honor him like that and just shows how supportive they are of each other. I think what I found most striking with this photo is you can see the goosebumps on her arm as people waved goodbye and cheered. NovemberZoe McDougall surfing at the Michelob ULTRA Pure Gold Haleiwa Challenger in Hawaii.Brent Bielmann/World Surf League via Getty Images11/07: Peres Jepchirchir of Kenya celebrates as she crosses the finish line to win the 2021 New York City Marathon.Elsa/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Elsa Garrison:It was great to cover the New York City Marathon after missing it last year due to Covid-19. Also, the fact that it was the 50th running of it this year. It was a perfect fall day in New York as Peres Jepchirchir emerged from the pack and was overcome with joy as she crossed the finish line. Three months ago in Tokyo, Jepchirchir won Olympic gold in the marathon, so it was special to see her victorious once again.11/11: Mikaela Shiffrin of Team USA skis during a Slalom Training session at Copper Mountain Resort in Colorado.Tom Pennington/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Tom Pennington:I shot this photo of Mikaela Shiffrin while she was training at Copper Mountain Resort in Colorado. I was able to ski into position on the racecourse, then scout out the best slalom gate to focus on.Once in position, I waited for Shiffrin to make a training run down the course. Using a 600 mm telephoto lens, I was able to isolate her from the background and really show her ski technique and body position while attacking the race course. All of these elements combined with the heavy snowfall came together to produce a dramatic image of Shiffrin in her element.11/14: Brazilian skateboarder Pamela Rosa reacts to winning the final for the SLS Super Crown World Championship in Jacksonville, Florida.Mike Ehrmann/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Mike Ehrmann:Pamela Rosa of Brazil had won the final for the SLS Super Crown World Championship here. It was an exciting day, especially with an entire crowd full of enthused fans.I love this shot here; the clean, blue background helps bring in the viewer straight to Rosa's reaction, as well as the details of her nails, tattoos, and overall body language.11/20: The Washington Spirit celebrate winning the 2021 NWSL Championship.Tim Nwachukwu/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Tim Nwachukwu:The NWSL Championship came in with what seemed like a mountain of storylines. In this photo, there's a sense of relief at the end of a long, and in different ways, painful season for the league and winners, Washington Spirit.The weight of off-field controversy, as well as playing two extra time periods can take a lot out of a fan so that must be unimaginable as a player. Add in a late winning goal and these are the reactions after moving a mountain (or three)! It was truly an incredible moment to capture.11/30: Australian star Sam Kerr shoots on goal under pressure from USWNT defender Alana Cook.Cameron Spencer/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Cameron Spencer:In the second of two friendly matches between the Australian Matildas and the United States Women's National Team, it was a tighter contest than their first game played in Sydney.

It's truly an incredible event for so many young and talented athletes. With the 2022 Winter Olympics around the corner, this was a great opportunity to showcase their skills and prepare for the highest levels of competition.This photo depicts Sarah Hoefflin, one of the sports' top skiers, competing on the final day. For this shot, I got down very low and used the snow to fill the foreground, leaving only a small window of sky for her to fly through. The end result worked out well because the snow almost appears like a layer of clouds below. Hopefully Sarah gets a chance to see it and performs great in the Beijing Olympic Games.12/6: Florida State players celebrate beating BYU in penalty kicks to win the Division I national championship.Jamie Schwaberow/NCAA Photos via Getty Images12/11: China's Xueton Cai competes in the Snowboard Halfpipe Final during the Toyota US Grand Prix in Copper Mountain, Colorado.Sean M.

This image was one I knew I wanted to get but getting the light, timing, and best athletes all in one image was the challenge.Here, I was lucky to find a spot where no other photographer was at the time. The sun was almost gone and the light in the track and ambient light were close enough in exposure to work in the image I was trying to get. The trees with snow made a nice panning color and shape and getting a slow enough camera shutter would work if I had a steady enough hand.The Maple Leaf of Canada in red stands out so you don't have to look to hard for the athlete's country and the motion in the pan gives the viewer a small sample of the speed Christine De Bruin was going at the time.12/17: Greta Espinoza of Tigres celebrates with teammates after scoring the first goal against Monterrey in front of 34,191 fans at BBVA Stadium in Monterrey, Mexico.Alfredo Lopez/Jam Media/Getty Images12/18: Thailand's Jenjira Srissard competes in the 50m Butterfly during the FINA World Swimming Championships in Abu Dhabi.Francois Nel/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Francois Nel:After covering swimming for a few days, it becomes quite challenging to find new angles and show each event in a different way. It was during the Women's 50m Butterfly that I decided to look for a different picture instead of the typical butterfly race picture with a head out of the water. There was black background that worked in my favor here, and it helps to isolate the subject, Jenjira Srissard of Thailand.12/18: Annika Morgan takes a practice run before the start of the women's snowboard slopestyle final of the Dew Tour at Copper Mountain.Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Ezra Shaw:It is always tough waking up when it's still dark out and heading out to the mountain before you know if there is going to be any nice light on the course yet. But then you realize it's worth it when you get to the slopestyle course and there is a touch of early morning sun lighting up the fog sitting in the valley as Annika Morgan of Germany takes a practice run before the start of the women's finals at the Dew Tour in Colorado.The fog burned off about 10-15 minutes after I got to this spot. I was able to capture a few different women going over this jump, but some were too high or too low, and others didn't have the right form — this one of Morgan worked out just right.12/18: Wisconsin Badgers players celebrate winning the Division I Women's Volleyball Championship.Jamie Schwaberow/NCAA Photos via Getty Images12/19: Adriana Jiménez of Mexico competes in the Women's High Dive during the FINA World Swimming Championships (25m) in Abu Dhabi.Francois Nel/Getty ImagesFrom the photographer, Francois Nel:The high dive is always an exciting event to cover, however this one was pretty tough due to the limited angles I could shoot from.

L. James' novel of the same name.","Jamie Dornan in ""Fifty Shades Freed.""Universal Pictures. Jamie Dornan said he wasn't worried about being typecast after his ""Fifty Shades"" role. He told The Telegraph that Christian Grey, a ""BDSM-loving billionaire,"" was a ""one-off"" role. ""Nothing close to that has come my way again – I've barely worn a suit since,"" the actor said. Jamie Dornan became the face of the erotic ""Fifty Shades"" blockbuster trilogy in 2015 as business tycoon Christian Grey. Though the critically-panned franchise proved to be a box-office sensation, the 39-year-old actor said he wasn't concerned about its potential impact on his future on-screen opportunities. ""At the time, I was asked if I was scared of being typecast – as what? As a BDSM-loving billionaire? I think that's a one-off,"" he told The Telegraph on Saturday, as reported by Us Weekly.

The 66-year-old actress – who has already received her booster jab – is experiencing mild symptoms after testing positive for the respiratory virus, and the news was confirmed by her co-host Joy Behar, who appeared on Monday’s episode remotely amid concerns due to the pandemic. Joy, 79 – who was joined on the show by Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines and guest host Ana Navarro – said: ‘They say there’s no place like home for the holidays and that’s exactly where we are this year. ‘Happy New Year from all of our living rooms. As you can see we’re back in boxes and doing the show remotely – hopefully for just a week, I’m praying that it’s just a week but you never know because this Omicron thing is all over the place. ‘Why am I here instead of Whoopi? Well, Whoopi, unfortunately, tested positive over the break but she’ll be back probably next week. Since she’s vaxxed and boosted, her symptoms have been very, very, mild. But we’re being super cautious here at The View.’ Sunny, 53, and her mom also tested positive for Covid over Christmas, and admitted that it was a difficult time for her family. .@JoyVBehar shares on #TheView that @WhoopiGoldberg tested positive for COVID-19 over the holiday break and is recovering at home: “Since she’s vaxxed and boosted, her symptoms have been very, very mild.”Get well soon, Whoopi! â¤ï¸ pic.twitter.com/Oo1Qakfbcn— The View (@TheView) January 3, 2022 Sunny – who kept in touch with her family via FaceTime over the holiday season – added that she is ‘thankful’ to have received her jabs because it lessened the impact of the virus. ‘I’m so thankful that I was vaccinated and boosted because I only had cold like symptoms, but I didn’t feel great honestly and it just goes to show you that the vaccine and the boosters do work,’ she said. ‘And it makes sure that you’re not hospitalised for something like this and it makes sure that you don’t die from something like this.’ Last month, Whoopi missed a couple of days on the show when she had potentially been exposed to the virus, with Joy again delivering the news at the time.

139,Arians: Antonio Brown's bizarre exit had nothing to do with injury after reports claim he refused to enter game,2022-01-03,"Antonio Brown's bizarre exit from Sunday's Tampa Bay Buccaneers game had nothing to do with an injury, according to head coach Bruce Arians.","TAMPA (WFLA) — Antonio Brown's bizarre exit from Sunday's Tampa Bay Buccaneers game had nothing to do with an injury, according to head coach Bruce Arians. Arians addressed the media on Monday as various claims surrounding Brown's theatrical departure from the team's victory against the New York Jets was due to an ankle injury he had been dealing with in recent weeks. ‘CTE is REAL’: Chiefs WR calls for help for Antonio Brown following latest incident ""I don't know that he was [injured],"" said Arians. ""It was pretty obvious what happened. He left the field and that was it."" ""We had a conversation and he left the field,"" Arians added after a follow-up question from the media. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Monday morning that Brown was instructed to go into the game against the New York Jets but the receiver refused due to his ankle injury. ""Midway through the game [Sunday], Bruce Arians and the offensive staff told Antonio Brown to go into the game. They believed that he was healthy,"" Rapoport said. ""Antonio Brown did not believe he was healthy. He had been battling an ankle injury for the last several weeks."" Brown had not participate in the Buccaneers practices on Thursday or Friday due to the injured ankle. From @GMFB: How and why did #Bucs WR Antonio Brown end up storming off the field shirtless to end his Tampa Bay career? pic.twitter.com/nd6xq0xMLp— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 3, 2022 ""What he told the staff, from what I understand, is that he was not going into the game because, in his mind, he did not feel he was healthy,"" Rapoport said. ""The response then from the offensive coaches and from Bruce Arians was, 'If you are not gonna go into the game when we tell you to go into the game, then you cannot be here.' At that point, they threw him off the sidelines and then cut him from the team."" Brown’s mid-game meltdown came late in the third quarter with Tampa Bay trailing 24-10. He appeared animated while talking to teammate Mike Evans when he stripped off his pads, jersey, gloves and T-shirt — tossing the gloves and T-shirt into the stands — and then walked bare-chested down the sideline and into the end zone. He then waved to fans as jogged through the end zone and into the tunnel at MetLife Stadium. It appeared to be a show of frustration by Brown, who had three catches for 26 yards. After the game, Arians said Brown is ""no longer a Buc.” However, the receiver is still officially on the roster as of Monday afternoon. Arians said Monday that general manager Jason Licht is working on roster moves surrounding Brown's exit from the team. On social media, people have shared concern for Brown's mental health after the erratic behavior during what could be his final NFL game. Arians said he hopes Brown is able to get help if he needs it. ""I wish him well. I hope if he needs help, [he] gets some. It's very hard because I do care about him."" Brown was suspended last month for three games for violating the league’s COVID-19 protocols. He also has a history of personal conduct issues and bizarre behavior.","['Buccaneers', 'Mobile', 'News', 'Sports', 'Top Stories', 'WFLA Now']",https://www.wfla.com/sports/buccaneers/arians-antonio-browns-bizarre-exit-had-nothing-to-do-with-injury-after-reports-claim-he-refused-to-enter-game/,,wfla

He attributed the attack to radicalized Covid deniers and anti-vaxxers. Read Full Article at RT.com,"Germany’s health minister said he was targeted by a ‘splinter group’ of ‘self-righteous’ protesters German authorities are investigating after Health Minister Karl Lauterbach’s local constituency office in Cologne was vandalized on New Year’s Eve. He attributed the attack to radicalized Covid deniers and anti-vaxxers. While state police have asked for witnesses to come forward, Lauterbach told the dpa news agency on Saturday that he suspected the same people had carried out previous attacks on the office and sent him threatening emails. On December 10, the office had reportedly been smeared with slogans such as “Minister of Sickness,” “Murderer,” and “Psycho Lauterbach.” According to published reports and images of the second attack, a fist-sized hole appears to have been punched in one of the windows. “These people do not represent society, where the overwhelming [majority] is really sticking together and trying to do everything against the pandemic,” Lauterbach, a member of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), said. [The attackers] represent a very small splinter group that self-righteously believes that they have to take a different path here and that got lost in the process. That’s just sad. Meanwhile, the office of Marco Wanderwitz, a lawmaker for the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) in the eastern state of Saxony, was also targeted. The windows of his office in the town of Zwönitz were heavily damaged, according to German media reports. Read more Poll reveals how many Germans trust official Covid data Wanderwitz told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) that far-right radicals were “poisoning society” during the Covid-19 pandemic and had left “democracy in great danger.” According to Deutsche Welle, Saxony and other eastern states have seen spikes in Covid cases, but are also among the country’s lowest vaccinated. There have also been heated protests in Saxony that grew more tense after the Bundestag passed a vaccine mandate for some professions in December. There is also widespread skepticism over the government’s official Covid-19 data, with a new survey poll by Bild newspaper finding that 57% of respondents did not trust the statistics.",,https://www.rt.com/news/545086-health-minister-office-vandalized-covid-restrictions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,,rt

However, many fans were quick to notice the Harry Potter actors missing from the reunion special, including David Thewlis. The actor, who played Professor Lupin in the films, is speaking out about his absence. Here’s what we know. David Thewlis | Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images ‘Harry Potter’ cast members missing from ‘Return to Hogwarts’ Return to Hogwarts reunited cast members like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, who played the iconic trio Harry, Hermione, and Ron in the eight Harry Potter films.

J.K. Rowling only appeared in clips recycled from a 2019 interview. Other Harry Potter stars like Alan Rickman and Richard Griffiths died before the reunion. Other significant actors from Harry Potter who did not participate in the reunion include: Dame Maggie Smith Michael Gambon Julie Walters Jim Broadbent Brendan Gleeson Harry Melling Devon Murray Josh Herdman Warwick Davis Fiona Shaw David Thewlis jokes about not participating in ‘Return to Hogwarts’  “Many of you have been asking why I was not present at the recent HP cast reunion,” the actor captioned an Instagram post on Jan. 2, 2022. He continued:  “Well, last year, as some of you may recall, I foolishly posted what I thought was an amusing picture of a Lupin action figure to which I had attached some comically large feet. It seems I did this on a sensitive anniversary, upsetting many. This led to an enormous number of fans (and some cast members) taking to the streets in protest and signing a petition demanding that I be banned from any future Potter celebrations. In my defense it was my wife’s idea. I did not realize the significance of the date and following the advice of my legal team the post has since been removed. I hope that has cleared things up.” When we first meet Remus Lupin he's a stranger on the Hogwarts Express, so we want to know before he became the Marauder we all know and love, what was your first impression of him? pic.twitter.com/kuGfSHNu91— Wizarding World (@wizardingworld) January 15, 2021 Thewlis, who is known for playing tricks like this on social media, had some fans convinced he was serious. “It is very difficult to know if you are being serious or not,” said one fan in the comments. “Well, one more reason to love you Mr. Thewlis!” ‘Harry Potter’ fans enjoy David Thewlis on social media  While Thewlis’ post confused some fans and raised concern, others understood the joke. “His whole Insta is hilariously surreal,” wrote a fan on Reddit. “I love his story about wanting to play Slughorn.”  As one fan surmised, Thewlis likely didn’t participate in the Harry Potter reunion because he is working on other projects.

143,‘Joe Millionaire’: Original Star Zora Andrich Says She Was ‘Relieved’ When She Learned Evan Marriott Wasn’t a Real Millionaire,2022-01-03,Original ‘Joe Millionaire’ star Zora Andrich reflects on her experience on the Fox reality series.,"Nineteen years ago, Joe Millionaire captivated TV audiences. Now, Fox is bringing back the controversial reality TV show, which saw a group of women competing to win the love of a “millionaire” who was actually a humble construction worker. Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer premieres Jan. 6. Ahead of the new season, original Joe Millionaire cast member Zora Andrich is reflecting on her time on the show. Zora Andrich won the heart of Evan Marriott on ‘Joe Millionaire’ Evan Marriott of ‘Joe Millionaire’ in 2003 | Kevin Winter/FOX/ImageDirect Andrich, then 29, was one of 20 women attempting to win the love of Evan Wallace, who they believed was a multi-millionaire. In reality, Wallace was actually Evan Marriott, a 28-year-old construction worker who earned less than $20,000 per year. Throughout the reality competition show‘s first season, Marriott struggled to decide which of the women were sincere in their affections and which were just interested in his supposed fortune. In the final episode – which was watched by 40 million people when it aired in February 2003, he chose Andrich, a substitute teacher. At that point, she learned the truth about Marriott’s financial status. She decided to stay with him anyway, and the couple shared a $1 million prize. They split shortly after. The ‘Joe Millionaire star says she was glad Evan wasn’t a real millionaire Zora Andrich, Paul Hogan, and Sarah Kozer of ‘Joe Millionaire’ | SGranitz/WireImage for VH-1 Channel – New York RELATED: ‘The Simple Life’: Nicole Richie Says She Would Be ‘Fine’ With Her Kids Being Reality TV Stars Andrich recently spoke to the New York Post about her time in the reality TV spotlight and her reaction to the show’s big twist. “​​I never felt duped,” she said of learning that Marriott was not a millionaire. “If anything, I felt relieved. Having had a very modest upbringing, I felt very intimidated by ‘his’ lavish lifestyle. I don’t think I could ever fully accept the ‘reality’ due to my own insecurities.” Andrich now works in healthcare and teaches yoga on the side. She and Marriott ended their brief relationship before the show even aired. However, the two have kept in touch sporadically. “Evan and I have talked over the years,” she said. “We share an experience of which few others can relate. Despite our differences, I really like Evan. His heart and character are intact – and I appreciate his unapologetic, bold personality.” What is the new ‘Joe Millionaire’ about? Joe Millionaire made a huge splash in its first season, but Fox wasn’t able to turn it into an enduring franchise like The Bachelor. A second season performed poorly in the ratings, and since then, the show has been dormant. But the network is reviving the concept with Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer. In the new show, two single men will date 20 single women. One of the men is a millionaire; the other is an “average Joe.” The women have no idea who is who. As each guy searches for his perfect match, the women will have to decide whether love or money is more important.

It provided a release for ‘any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant’ against various claims made by Giuffre. US District Judge Lewis Kaplan will now have to decide whether that clause blocks Giuffre’s lawsuit against the royal, who she alleges forced her to have sex with him two decades ago when she was 17. Lawyers for the Duke have claimed that the agreement would prevent Giuffre from continuing the battery lawsuit she filed against him in 2020 because it absolved him of liability for future cases. Andrew has denied the allegations and is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit. A hearing over his motion to dismiss is scheduled for Tuesday.

147,Mapping tools help people understand pollution in their neighborhood,2022-01-03,A 2012 California state law required the state's Environmental Protection Agency to identify communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution.,"Technology is changing the way pollution is tracked across the United States.That is clear in California, where a tool called CalEnviroScreen allows users to find out the relative impact of pollution on their community.""The idea was to try to understand and address this issue of cumulative impacts,"" said Dr. John Faust, who works in California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. ""CalEnviroScreen is a geographic screening tool that's intended to identify communities in California that are burdened by multiple sources of pollution.""The team at California's OEHHA first published CalEnviroScreen in 2013. The tool is now in its fourth edition.Californians or other interested parties can look up the relative pollution in any U.S. Census tract in the state.""There are about 21 [indicators] that represent different types of pollution,"" said Dr. Faust, ""like air quality, water quality ... the presence of solid waste, landfills, and so forth. Each of those has an indicator that is scored in relation to all the other Census tracts in the state. For example, an 89 percentile in a given Census tract means that the score is higher than 89% of the other Census tracts across the state.""The publicly available tool is just one way the data is used.A 2012 California state law required the state's Environmental Protection Agency to identify communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution.CalEnviroScreen was developed to help meet that goal. Data scientists had to assemble a variety of statistics from different state and federal agencies. Experts have called the finished product groundbreaking.""Bringing all the data sets to a uniform geography, the Census tract, was pretty new for a lot of the data sets in CalEnviroScreen,"" said Laura August, a scientist at OEHHA. ""The data might have existed, but we had to develop methods to aggregate it at a similar uniform scale for all the data sets.""""At this point,"" said Dr. Faust, ""several billions of dollars have been allocated to disadvantaged communities as a result of this program.""The federal government has a similar mapping tool, EJSCREEN. It contains many of the same features as CalEnviroScreen, but does not include state-specific data, such as pesticide reporting.Other states are developing their own tools.""Washington state has had a similar initiative, and I know the state of Michigan has also started on this path,"" said Dr. Faust. ""And as I understand, the state of Colorado's department of public health and environment is also committed to looking at the development of a similar tool.""OEHHA leaders say this tool would not have been possible without the technological innovations of the last decade.""When I started 12 years ago, online, interactive maps weren't as easily developed and created,"" said August. ""And now, it's just kind of a standard, that we can put our data on a map, that someone can search their address. That technology has definitely been a benefit.""",,https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/mapping-tools-help-people-understand-pollution-in-their-neighborhood,,wcpo

152,This is why omicron is so highly transmissible,2022-01-03,"According to the most recent CDC data, released on Christmas, omicron accounted for 58.6% of all positive COVID-19 cases nationwide.","In less than a month, the omicron variant of COVID-19 has gone from being first detected in the US to the dominant variant circulating.According to the most recent CDC data released on Christmas, omicron accounted for 58.6% of all positive COVID-19 cases nationwide.“This current virus- the omicron variant- has about 50 mutations; more than 30 in the spike protein domain, which is more mutations than we’ve seen in any of the coronavirus variants so far,” said Dr. Phil Stahel, Chief Medical Officer at the Medical Center of Aurora in Colorado.For comparison, delta had around 13 mutations. Dr. Stahel says the vast number of mutations in omicron means our body’s antibodies have a more difficult time recognizing COVID as COVID.It is the main reason why researchers say omicron is 20x more transmissible than the original strain of COVID-19 and 2.5 times as transmissible as delta, even if you are vaccinated.“Omicron has mutated so much that it has less affinity in terms of the antibodies from the vaccine recognizing it, so, therefore, the answer is the booster shot, because you will overwhelm the virus with the quantity of the immune response even if there is not a perfect match,” said Dr. Stahel.A study out of Denmark shows people with the booster were 56% less likely to become infected by omicron if a member in their household had it compared to people who only had two doses of the vaccine.Go deeper, however, the vaccine does appear to do a great job of preventing serious infection. Researchers in South Africa found that even though omicron’s mutations allow it to circumvent the vaccine’s antibodies easily, it does a poor job at escaping T-cells, our body’s second line of defense that prevents serious infection.The kicker though: that only applies to people who have been infected in the last three months or are vaccinated.“We may still get the virus. We may still get sick. We may be miserable for a few days, but it is no longer a catastrophe. We will not be admitted to hospitals, and we will not die from SARS-COVID-2,” said Dr. Stahel.Moving forward, Dr. Stahel says COVID will become more of a common cold, but that will only happen until we reach herd immunity.Until then, he and other researchers say omicron poses more of a significant risk of serious health issues and death in those who are unvaccinated compared to those who are.",,https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/this-is-why-omicron-is-so-highly-transmissible,,wcpo

It’s one of her comforting soups for cold nights. And, according to reviewers, the celebrity chef’s creamy soup is delicious and easy to make. Giada De Laurentiis’ White Velvet Soup is a ‘healthy winter dinner,’ according to the cookbook author Giada De Laurentiis | Amy Sussman/Getty Images Entertainment Video for Food Network Despite being creamy and smooth, De Laurentiis’ White Velvet Soup isn’t loaded with cream. The cookbook author explained a little bit about the soup on her Giadzy blog, revealing how it gets its silky texture sans cream. “This white velvet soup is the hearty, healthy winter dinner you need in your life! Full of parsnips, fennel, celery, and onion, it’s different from your typical vegetable soup,” De Laurentiis said. “The veggies get sautéed and then cooked in simmering water, and then puréed into a rich, creamy soup.” “Unsweetened almond milk thins out the purée just enough without drastically changing the flavor,” she added. “This soup is similar in texture to a butternut squash or sweet potato soup, but something about its simplicity makes it feel extra luxurious.” The Food Network star’s White Velvet Soup can be made ahead Just like De Laurentiis’ make-ahead lasagna recipe, her White Velvet Soup can also be made in advance. “You can make this soup in advance, keep it in the fridge, and just warm it up the day of which is so fantastic,” De Laurentiis said on Giada’s Holiday Handbook.  The make-ahead element, as she explained, is crucial to hosting a stress-free dinner party. “The trick to good entertaining is to make as much of the meal and as many of the dishes in advance as possible,” she said.  If she makes the White Velvet Soup in advance the Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef prefers to use a popular kitchen gadget to reheat it. “What I like to do is make a soup and pull out my slow cooker,” De Laurentiis said. “it’s like a soup bar in a way.” Reviewers love De Laurentiis’ soup recipe Giada de Laurentiis | Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire At the time of writing, De Luarentiis’ White Velvet Soup averages 4.5 stars on Food Network’s website. Whether or not they made it for Thanksgiving dinner or a cold night, reviewers praised the recipe. “This was so, so good! I made it a day ahead of my party last night, and I think that made it even better. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe,” one reviewer said before adding that it was “VERY easy to make, too!” Another reviewer described it as “a delicious, creamy, veggie-based soup that’s perfect for the winter months.” The love for the soup didn’t stop there. They also loved how it “tastes rich and creamy” with “no dairy at all.” Another reviewer noted how the “deceptively rich” soup, which gets creaminess from a splash of almond milk, had their guests thinking it contained cream.

Further up the coast, New York City’s three major airports saw a quarter of their flights delayed or canceled as well.

Maxwell was convicted on five of six charges for helping Jeffrey Epstein run a decades-long sex trafficking ring. Legal experts told Insider that Maxwell's only options for a lighter sentence are to appeal or cooperate. Ghislaine Maxwell will not reveal information about others involved with helping disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein run his decades-long sex-trafficking network, her brother told The Sunday Times. Maxwell, a longtime employee and girlfriend of Epstein's, was convicted on five of six charges on December 29. Maxwell was found guilty on three conspiracy counts, one separate sex-trafficking count, and a count for transporting a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity.She now faces up to 65 years in prison for those charges, and still faces a second trial for charges related to lying under oath in a deposition.Legal experts previously told Insider that Maxwell's only options after her conviction are to fight her case on appeal, or start cooperating with investigators to receive a lighter sentence. The names of several high-profile people, including Prince Andrew, appeared in evidence during Maxwell's trial.Her brother, Ian Maxwell, told The Sunday Times that Ghislaine Maxwell maintains her innocence and has no plans to pursue a plea deal with prosecutors.""Prosecution confirmed no plea bargain offers were made or received"" before the trial, Ian Maxwell told the newspaper.

I was on a call (hands-free) while I was parking my car close to the filling station. I got out of the car to check the meter and took my phone with me. As soon as the fuel pump employee saw me talking on the phone, he asked me to cut the phone, showing concern and urgency. I agreed and dropped the call immediately. This left me thinking, what harm would a phone do at a petrol pump? When we visit, petrol pumps, we often see a sign asking us not to burn anything, not to smoke, and not to even take calls at the fuel-filling station. But have you wondered how could something as harmless as an incoming/outgoing call, cause an explosion or fire. This obviously made me curious enough to go home and search “does using the phone at petrol pump cause fire’ on YouTube. To no one’s surprise, there’s nothing concrete I could find apart from some videos that allegedly show fire/explosions being caused by the use of a phone. There are some questionable “experiments” as well, which show petrol fumes catching fire in the proximity of a phone making calls. So what’s the verdict then? Numerous studies have revealed that there’s almost no chance of a phone causing fire. According to a study by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a regulatory body of the United States, there is no evidence that the reports of phone causing fires are true. While it may be “theoretically possible for a spark from a cell phone battery to ignite gas vapor,” the FCC concludes the potential threat is remote. Then what about all the CCTV camera footage that claim the fire or explosion was caused by phones? One of the main culprits that have been found to cause a spark and eventually a fire is static electricity. Movement or friction can cause static electricity. While fuel pumps are grounded, there are petrol fumes close to the nozzle. In order to stay safe people visiting petrol pumps are often advised to: -Turn off the engine. -Not to smoke. -Never re-enter your vehicle while refueling.

Some viewers walked away from the episode absolutely livid with Kody and his treatment of his sons. His use of the term ""her kids"" struck fans as particularly telling.","Kody Brown is doing very little to shore up his image during season 16 of Sister Wives. Fans of the famed series have long preferred Kody’s four wives over him, but the most recent season has taken things to a new level for many viewers. Fans have noted that Kody’s choice of words when discussing several of the family’s 18 children is problematic. His actions don’t paint him as a particularly involved father, either. Kody Brown is the father of 18 children  Sister Wives premiered in 2010 when the Brown family consisted of 12 children, three wives, and one husband. By the time the first season was over, the Browns had added several children and one wife to their family. Two more children were born along the way, one separation happened, and Kody became a grandfather three times over.  Kody Brown and family | Denise Truscello/WireImage Kody and Meri Brown, his first wife, share one child. Janelle Brown and Kody have six children as do Christine Brown, Kody’s now-estranged third wife, and Kody. Kody and Christine’s youngest child, Truely Brown, was born during season 1 of Sister Wives. Robyn Brown brought three children into the family with her. Kody adopted her son and two daughters from a previous marriage in 2015. Robyn and Kody also share Solomon Brown and Ariella Brown.   ‘Sister Wives’ fans note that Kody refers to the Brown kids as ‘her children’ in recent episodes  Sister Wives viewers have noted that Kody seems more invested in the lives of the children he shares with Robyn Brown than the children he has with his three other wives. The discussion has been ongoing for more than a year, but the Jan. 2 episode of the TLC series punctuated just how divided the Brown family has become. While much of the episode was about holiday plans, Kody’s choice of words about the kids struck family followers as a little strange. During a confessional, Kody attempted to explain his feelings about Janelle Brown’s stance on coronavirus (COVID-19) and what she allows to happen in her home. While discussing his problems with Gabriel and Garrison Brown’s social movements, Kody referred to them as “her kids.” Fans were quick to point out that Kody is the biological father of both young men. It isn’t the first time he’s used the odd wording, either. During season 15 of Sister Wives, he regularly referred to the children he shares with Christine Brown, Meri Brown, and Janelle as “her kids” instead of “our kids.” A Reddit user points out that Kody uses the wording almost exclusively when discussing the children he fathered with his first three wives. To be fair, Kody’s actions don’t paint him as an involved father, either  Kody’s statements about Gabriel and Garrison might have touched a nerve with some fans, but it’s far from the first time family followers have called Kody out on his treatment of his children. In fact, the last two seasons of Sister Wives and the social media musings of his children appear to paint Kody as an absentee father.  Robyn Brown and Kody Brown, ‘Sister Wives’ | TLC Sister Wives cameras captured Kody refusing to accompany his daughter, Ysabel Brown, for a grueling spinal surgery in New Jersey. He also opted not to see Mariah Brown when they returned to Flagstaff for a visit. According to social media posts, Kody also opted out of seeing his daughter off to prom and hadn’t met his newest granddaughter during the first six months of her life. Meanwhile, Kody appears to be spending plenty of quality time with his fourth wife, Robyn, and the five children in her house.

One of its main tools is the D.I.E Shockwave Wonder Weapon, so here’s how to get it, upgrade it, and an explanation of its improvements. One of the most satisfying elements of CoD Zombies is when you obtain one of the game’s OP weapons. Ray Gun wonder weapons are a staple of the game mode. As the years have gone by, Zombie-killing hardware has become more advanced and entertaining. Cold War may have been superseded by Vanguard, but the troubled launch and lack of support for Zombies have sent players back to Treyarch’s previous effort.

The post ‘BioShock’ creator Ken Levine’s studio in turmoil, according to report appeared first on NME.","A recent report suggests that Ken Levine’s studio Ghost Story Games has trouble creating content and has lost half of its founders. READ MORE: Looking back on 30 years of ‘Sonic The Hedgehog’ with composer Jun Senoue According to a report from Bloomberg, Ken Levine’s auteur management style has caused development hell at Ghost Story Games. In the report, staff members have been contacted who say that the studio has failed to produce a game. The studio was formed eight years ago when Irrational Games closed, with 11 members of the previous studio joining together to create a smaller team that could be more experimental in their design. While still owned by Take-Two, the parent company that previously owned Irrational, the company is seemingly untroubled by funding or oversight. This has allowed them immense freedom to create whatever they would like. In 2014, BioShock director Ken Levine shut down his studio to start a smaller company. Eight years later, nothing has come from it. Half the founders have quit. This is a story about a video game auteur whose management style has hurt a lot of people: https://t.co/N9HAetQHQ5 — Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) January 3, 2022 The first product of this freedom is a style of game described as “narrative Lego”, where each player would have a different experience based on their actions. However, this has caused problems. The report describes Levine as someone who likes to see each section of a project and evaluate it as it is created. However, the narrative Lego approach means that many parts of the game are incomplete when viewed and are frequently scrapped by Levine. Levine’s tendency to cut content is nothing new, with him saying that he cut enough from Bioshock Infinite to make two games. However, after so much time developing without producing a product, many staff members felt it was time to leave. Over half of the original Irrational staff have left Ghost Story Games. “The ideas and ambitions were great,” Giovanni Pasteris, an early employee, wrote to Bloomberg in an email. “But the scope just grew and grew without concern for the team’s ability to get it done by our fall 2017 deadline. Ken wanted to make a triple-A game with a ‘budget’ team size. It was never going to happen.” In other news, the director of Driveclub will reveal his next game this year, and it isn’t a racing game.

165,2022 Team Preview: Movistar Team Women,2022-01-03,Sarah Gigante joins Annemiek van Vleuten to form powerful climbing duo in hilly Classics and mountainous stage races,"Who? Manager: Sebastian Unzue GravalosSquad size: 14Average age: 27 Movistar Team Women have steadily grown over the last five seasons to become one of the outstanding teams racing on Women's WorldTour. Since starting in 2018 with the goal of providing opportunities to Spanish riders, they have flourished little-by-little each season into a winning team with an international roster.The blue-clad squad made their biggest rider signing last year with former road and time trial World Champion and reigning Olympic time trial champion Annemiek van Vleuten. She brought the team victories at the Tour of Flanders but also on home soil at Setmana Ciclista Valenciana, Emakumeen Nafarroako Women's Elite Classics, Donostia San Sebastian Klasikoa Women and Ceratizit Challenge by La Vuelta. Ultimately, she gave the team a sure card to play for wins in top-tier pro bike races.The team have maintained their intent to develop future talent, too, with fast-rising talents like Emma Norsgaard and team newcomers Arlenis Sierra and Sarah Gigante. Together these riders make up the future of Movistar Team Women at a wide range of races including the punchy one-day races, sprints, and mountainous stage races.The team announced a 14-rider roster, once again led by Van Vleuten, and that also includes Sierra, Gigante, Norsgaard along with Katrine Aalerud, Aude Biannic, Jelena Erić, Alicia González, Barbara Guarischi, Sheyla Gutiérrez, Sara Martín, Lourdes Oyarbide, Paula Patiño, and Gloria Rodríguez. How did they fare in 2021? Wins: 21World Ranking: Third Team Movistar Women secured 21 victories last year shared amongst Van Vleuten, Norsgaard, Aalerud, Erić, and Leah Thomas, along with the superb team effort by supporting riders at the races.All of the riders played a role in the team securing third place in the UCI World Ranking behind SD Worx and Trek-Segafredo. However, van Vleuten's whopping 5,053.33 points, which secured her the individual ranking lead, made up the majority of the team's overall 9067.66 points.Overall, the team fared well last year with success across a wide range of terrain from the Spring Classics to stage races and at all levels from x.1-, x.Pro, and WWT races on the international calendar.Van Vleuten brought the team success in the spring with wins at Dwars door Vlaanderen and Tour of Flanders, their biggest win ever, along with a series of races in Spain that were important to the team and their home sponsors. She also won the Ladies Tour of Norway. Norsgaard secured wins at early-season stage race Festival Elsy Jacobs, Thüringen Ladies Tour, Giro d'Italia Donne. Aalerud and Erić secured national titles in Norway and Serbia, respectively, while Thomas won the Tour de l'Ardeche to close out a successful season. Key Riders Sarah Gigante of Team Australia (Image credit: Getty Images Sport) Annemiek van Vleuten - Winner of both the individual Women's WorldTour and UCI World Ranking, Van Vleuten brought the team more success in one season than they have had since their inception five years ago. She opted to skip the Giro d'Italia Donne in favour of the Olympic Games where she secured silver medal in the road race and gold in the time trial. She aims return her focus to the Spring Classics, and then back-to-back Giro d'Italia Donne and Tour de France Femmes in July, where is the only rider who could feasibly win overall titles at both events.Sarah Gigante - Gigante joined the Spanish team on a three-year deal so that she could work under the tutelage of Van Vleuten. They are similar riders - both successful time traillists and powerful climbers - but at just 21 years old, Gigante has a lot to learn about the ins-and-outs of pro bike racing. She was one of the most sought-after riders last season as a former elite road race champion and two-time time trial champion from Australia. Injuries prevented her from showing her full potential during last season but now that she is healthy, the sky is the limit for Gigante. Emma Norsgaard - Norsgaard is one of the most exciting riders on the Women's WorldTour with a versatile range that includes punchy terrain, sprints, and time trials. She rocketed to success last year with an overall win at Festival Elsy Jacobs and victories at Thüringen Ladies Tour and Giro d'Italia Donne. She participated in her first Olympic Games. She has extended with Movistar Team Women through 2024 and we can expect to watch her continue to develop, win a magnitude of races, all along the path way to the next Olympic Games.Arlenis Sierra - It was only a matter of time before Sierra landed a big WorldTour contract and she signed with Movistar Team Women through 2023. She has been one of the strongest puncheurs in the peloton during her career in the elite ranks and joins the team after spending five seasons with Astana and last year with A.R. Monex. Last year she won Navarra Women's Elite Classics, a stage at the Tour de l'Ardèche, and two stages and the overall title at Giro Toscana. She capped off the year with a fifth place at the Flanders World Championships and a win at Tre Valli Varesine Women's Race. Strengths Emma Norsgaard (Movistar) (Image credit: Getty Images) Movistar Team Women have quickly become one of the most versatile and winning teams in professional women's cycling. They now truly have riders who can do it all. With Van Vleuten and Gigante, the team have a veteran champion and her protégé for the hilly Classics, time trials, and high-mountain stage race like the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France Femmes. Van Vleuten is still in her prime but as she considers future retirement, the team will develop Gigante so that she's ready to take the reins. They also have two champions for the punchy terrain and sprints in Norsgaard and Sierra, both will grow into leadership roles during the 2022 season and beyond. Most importantly, the team have great cohesion and an environment with which to excel with financial support and infrastructure, the best equipment and gear, and a family-style atmosphere that makes everyone feel valued. Weaknesses Each season Movistar Team Women make progress with steady gains and small adjustments. Two years ago, they were consistently placing in the top 10. Last year, they won the Tour of Flanders and finished with the top-placed rider in the Women's WorldTour and World Ranking with Van Vleuten, and with stand-out success from Norsgaard. It's hard to find a weakness in the team this year given their commitment to filling the gaps with riders like Gigante and Sierra, who bring the depth the team was lacking in previous years.If we have to pick out a problem area it is that a 14-rider roster might be stretched thin on the approaching calendar that now includes the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France Femmes in July, the new Battle of the North and return of an expanded RideLondon. This isn't just a Movistar-specific issue, however, as all of the top women's teams will need to grow in roster size, staff and infrastructure to meet the growing demands of the Women's WorldTour. Verdict Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar) (Image credit: Getty Images) In just five short years, Movistar Team Women has become one of the most competitive teams in professional cycling. It's been a steady work in progress backed by a commitment of Telefonica to foster inclusion and gender equality and built on the same management, sponsors and staff as their long-time men's WorldTour outfit.Last year marked the most successful season for the Spanish team with the signing of Van Vleuten, and development and rise of Norsgaard. The next step is to build depth and they are well on their way with signing newcomers Gigante and Sierra. The team's cohesion is their biggest asset and so with valuable support from riders Aalerud, Biannic, Erić, González, Guarischi, Gutiérrez, Martín, Oyarbide, Patiño, and Rodríguez, who can win races in their own right, will bring this team to the top step of the podium on the Women's WorldTour.",,https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/2022-team-preview-movistar-team-women/,,cyclingnews

The prolific striker is likely to leave Borussia Dortmund in the summer, once his release clause activates. It sits at between £63-68million. United and City are two of the clubs aiming to land the 21-year-old. The Red Devils will need a long-term replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo. Edinson Cavani, meanwhile, is 34 and could retire in the next few years. City are yet to replace Sergio Aguero, who left for Barcelona in July before hanging up his boots due to a heart condition. Gabriel Jesus was expected to step up to the plate but now wants to operate out wide. Barcelona have brought in Ferran Torres from the Citizens to become Aguero’s successor. The Spaniard has moved to the Nou Camp for £46.3m, with the deal funded by a loan. At Torres’ unveiling, Laporta was asked about the potential for more impressive captures. Haaland’s name was thrown into the mix. Laporta responded (via The Guardian): “We’re working to build a top team. Everything is possible if we do things well, and I’m sure we will. Top players are open to joining Barca. We’re definitely recovering our status.” The chief added: “Everybody in the world should get ready, as we are back as big players in the market. Barca are back!” Laporta seems confident his team can win the race for Haaland, as well as other top-class players. United and City will need to put up a fight to sign the Norwegian hitman. Barcelona’s rivals Real Madrid plan to bring in both Haaland and Kylian Mbappe this summer. A recent report from Spanish outlet AS claims Haaland has made a decision on his future. He allegedly told a group of fans: “I will play here, in Spain.” Man Utd decision to impact Liverpool Meanwhile, the agent of a Liverpool star claims a United transfer decision will impact him. Ralf Rangnick’s side recently recalled Axel Tuanzebe from his loan spell at Aston Villa. The defender is now edging closer to a Napoli move, according to BBC Sport. Liverpool’s Nat Phillips has been on Napoli’s radar, but his agent Colin Murdock says the vacancy is now filled. Give our social media channels a follow – we’re on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram “Napoli have taken Axel Tuanzebe, our former client, on loan, so I think they have finished their operations as regards to the role of central defender. Therefore, I don’t think we need further comments on Nat Phillips,” he said. Tuanzebe has made 37 appearances for United in all competitions. He has also had three temporary spells at Villa since 2018.

However, with a rise in COVID cases, some parents have decided their kids will learn from home until things get better.“It was a tough decision to come too, but we decided that this was the thing to do,” Molly Shook said. She’s a parent to students enrolled at CPS and Norwood.The recent surge in COVID cases on the back of the Omicron variant has some parents like Shook concerned.“We know that from an academic standpoint, it would be ideal for our kids to be in school, but we also know that this Omicron variant is really transmissible.

169,Brooke Shields Was Ghosted by Liam Neeson After He Proposed to Her,2022-01-03,Superstar Brooke Shields was previously engaged to 'Taken' star Liam Neeson but was given the silent treatment with no warning after spending the holidays together in the early 90s.,"Brooke Shields and husband Chris Henchy tied the knot in 2001 and have two daughters, Rowan and Grier. The Endless Love star had several celebrity romances over the years, including her first marriage to tennis pro Andre Agassi. Shields previously revealed she considered heading to the altar with Taken star Liam Neeson until he cut communication with her after the holidays. Liam Neeson and Brooke Shields | Rick Maiman/Sygma via Getty Images Brooke Shields lived in NYC when she dated Liam Neeson Shields and Neeson crossed paths in the early 90s. The former Calvin Klein model hadn’t starred in a film or TV show for years and was spending time exploring creative outlets like photography and fashion. Neeson charmed Shields with his easygoing nature. “He was a tall Irish actor and a drunk who was 13 years my senior,” Shields wrote of Neeson in her memoir, There Was a Little Girl. “He wooed me with his brogue, his poetry, and his sh**** chioce of cheat pinto grigio wine. I rebelled with him and poured myself into his rhythm.” Their bohemian lifestyle suited Shields at that point in her life, who has been open about being raised by an alcoholic mother. She found her unstructured routine with Neeson familiar and comforting. “I would take dance classes all morning and then meet up with him at the bar at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Central Park South,” she recalled. “We’d drink. … and discuss literature and acting. We would daydream about our future.” RELATED: Brooke Shields Says She Went from ‘Lolita’ to ‘Most Famous Virgin’ Liam Neeson proposed to Brooke Shields after 3 months of dating In her book, Shields shared how she was trying to break free of her close relationship with her mom and Neeson provided a convenient escape. “During those days, I existed on cheese and crackers and wine and the relationship,” the Suddenly Susan star wrote. “I was going to grow up and the Irish drinking actor was the perfect solution. I was so impressed with going out with a real movie star and I was so familiar with what it was like to live with an alcoholic who lived in dreamworlds.” Shields considered Neeson’s credibility in show business as her opportunity to break back into films and television, while also getting out from under her mother’s thumb. “We got serious enough after only three months,” Shields explained. “I thought that this would get me away from my mother and earn me the respect I wanted so desperately. He was a real actor, and if he chose me, then I would be exposed to a higher caliber of the entertainment industry. I could finally be serious. He asked me to marry him but without a ring.” Brooke Shields got radio silence from Liam Neeson Despite the absence of a diamond on her finger, Shields took Neeson’s proposal seriously. “I pretended I was engaged,” she remarked. “We spent a Christmas together. … Liam had to fly to LA that night to check on a basement flood in his home. I told him to phone me when he arrived.” Neeson warned her that he would be home late, but Shields insisted and reminded him, “You did ask me to marry you, so you can tell me the plane was safe.” She added, “I never heard from him again.” Shields later revealed that she did end up speaking with Neeson after his initial ghosting, and he attempted to win her back. “He came back after the first time he left me and asked me to marry him again,” she told People in 2014. “This was before he started to do a play [Anna Christie]. And I said, ‘No, no, no, because knowing you, you’ll probably fall in love with your next leading lady and marry her, so I’m leaving myself out of this.’ And I was dead right.” Neeson’s leading lady was Natasha Richardson. The two married in 1994 and remained together until her death in 2009.

It’s been a dream of mine, so it was really exciting to finally get to be a part of it,” Morgan Whitbred, who was an ice crew manager at Rogers Place, told CityNews. She was one of hundreds of people who worked behind the scenes to make sure the competition could run. However, Whitbred now joins many in losing out on employment, as well as an experience. “For health and safety, I totally understand. It was great while it lasted, it was just really sad and hard to adjust to for sure,” she admitted. Camera operator Patrick Strevens is in the same boat. He says the outcome is of course disappointing but adds it’s not just about a paycheck. “There’s the energy and the excitement of being a part of something bigger than you. All that is lost,” he explained. While many people hired to run the World Juniors are now at a loss, the cancellation of games has also hit local businesses in the pocketbook. There are many around Rogers Place who say they’re already feeling the impact. “We thought it was going to be a big week for us, 100 per cent. You notice where your number are, you notice how things are going. January is already a slow month but yeah, it’s come down a lot,” said Stevie Harrison, a server at Kelly’s Pub in Edmonton. Meanwhile, the Edmonton Oilers are facing more postponements upon the team’s return from its latest road trip. The games that do go ahead will be held with capacity restrictions.",,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/01/03/world-juniors-alberta-staff-loses-covid/,,citynews1130

While out on a stroll with her husband Charlie McDowell, the 32-year-old actress saw that a billboard with her in character as the perky Emily Cooper had been given a rather demonic makeover. Lily, who married the writer and director in September last year, clearly found the situation amusing, as she posted a video on Instagram of Charlie looking up at the image and then running away scared, while Lily shared a picture of herself looking shocked at the artwork. Underneath the video, the Love, Rosie star wrote: ‘I can’t say I love the new look, Em. But A for effort.’ Emily in Paris follows the adventures of the titular character, a bright-eyed and eager American who is offered the chance to move to Paris to work for the marketing firm that was just purchased by the larger firm she worked for in Chicago. The second season explored Emily’s love interests further, as she became embroiled in a love triangle (or square) with Lucas Bravo’s Gabriel and Lucien Laviscount’s Alfie. https://www.instagram.com/p/CYPcrzwppRE/ Lily and Charlie got married in September last year (Picture: Getty Images) While fans have dubbed the series an ‘escapist dream’ the show has come under fire for its portrayals of different nationalities. Following the release of season one, critics accused it of overusing French stereotypes.  Lily responded to the backlash, telling Vogue Arabia: ‘As disheartening as it sometimes is to read these things, it’s also a gift; you’re being allowed to improve.’ The 20 Minutes website wrote: ‘The berets. The croissants. The baguettes. The hostile waiters. The irascible concierges. The inveterate philanderers. The lovers and the mistresses.

177,What Investors Miss About Tesla Energy,2022-01-03,There is more to Tesla's giant batteries than meets the eye.,"For electric vehicle maker and renewable energy stalwart Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), batteries are a lousy way to make money. Lots of companies compete to make them cheaply, keeping batteries' profit margins low. To cash in on them, Tesla needs to add brains to batteries' brawn – and luckily for Tesla, its Autonomous Control software does exactly that. When paired with renewables and storage, Tesla's software holds the power to disrupt the U.S.'s roughly $400 billion electric utility market and create a new era of abundant energy, distributed power, and virtual power plants – a massive opportunity that too many investors are completely overlooking. The US grid suffers from polluting power plants, wasted electricity, and blackouts. It must also maintain a delicate balance-constantly predicting the exact power supply and demand. Solar and wind cannot solve these problems alone; these sources produce the most energy at a time with relatively low demand. But adding energy storage solves this intermittency problem, adds an extra margin of safety against blackouts, and reduces the grid's carbon footprint.

That’s the upshot of a new piece of security research that has found a vulnerability capable of locking iOS devices into a spiral of freezing, crashing, and rebooting if a user connects to a sabotaged Apple Home device. The vulnerability, discovered by security researcher Trevor Spiniolas, can be exploited through Apple’s HomeKit API, the software interface that allows an iOS app to control compatible smart home devices. If an attacker creates a HomeKit device with an extremely long name — around 500,000 characters — then an iOS device that connects to it will become unresponsive once it reads the device name and enter a cycle of freezing and rebooting that can only be ended by...

But unfortunately, I don’t always have the best days,” he told The Race. “I can’t say that I exceeded any of my expectations. I have pretty high expectations for myself, personally. Maybe a bit too high.” He said that the beginning of this season was pretty much a disaster with all the crashes and what felt to him like endless engine penalties. “It just wasn’t quite meant to be so far,” he said. But I have to say in the five years, there’ve been moments that I don’t know if I should cry or laugh about my luck because I don’t really feel like I’ve been the luckiest driver with many things,” he further explained.

187,‘I want to be better paid’ - BJJ star not sure he’ll compete at next IBJJF Worlds,2022-01-02,,"Kaynan Duarte at IBJJF Worlds against Adam Wardzinski. | IBBJF YouTube Atos star plans to focus on ADCC with lack of pay competing in the gi. When looking at the brackets for the 2021 IBJJF World Championships, there were many new black belts expected to win their first titles, but there were also some veterans expected to add another title to their collections. One such veteran was Kaynan Duarte of Atos Jiu-Jitsu. Since receiving his black belt in 2018 atop the Worlds podium after a brown belt championship run, Kaynan has gone on to become a dominant force in the heavyweight division. He’s won IBJJF Pans, Pans No-Gi, ADCC, Abu Dhabi Pro, Spyder Invitational, and many other important competitions. Despite winning a world title in the gi in 2021, Kaynan focused much more on no-gi. He competed at Subversiv, Road to ADCC, and Who’s #1, showing new wrinkles in his game. His investment in the leg lock game paid off as well, with three heel hooks and one calf slicer submission in 2021. Part of Kaynan’s interest in the no-gi game may be related to the compensation, or lack thereof, that he’s received competing in gi. The IBJJF currently offers cash prizes to its world champions and to winners of its grand prix events, which also take place just once a year as part of the World Masters event. 2021 world champions received payouts based on the size of their respective brackets, with a maximum potential payout of $7,000 for a division with 33+ competitors. The absolute division winner currently receives $10,000, so the maximum total payout for a winner of their division and the absolute is $17,000. Recently, many athletes have been more vocal about the lack of compensation from the IBJJF. In an interview with Vitor Freitas via VF Comunica, Kaynan Duarte discussed this issue. “I still don’t know if I’ll fight the next Worlds in 2022,” Duare said (Translation provided by Vitor Freitas). I don’t know if it’s going to be something I’m aiming for, you know? I want to be better paid, have more support. Surely the reward could be better. What they (IBJJF) are paying is nothing, you know? I did seven fights in their event. I fought because I wanted to, you know? I’m fighting because I want to. When I don’t want to fight anymore I won’t fight. They helped me in some ways for sure. Where I was and where I am today is because of the IBJJF. I can’t not be grateful. But a fight I do in another event I win three times or four times more than I win at the Worlds. I won $5,000 at the Worlds. In a fight with Meregali I would make a lot more money, you know? A big fight. That $5,000 amount doesn’t even pay for my preparation.” Based on these comments and Kaynan’s 2021 no-gi campaign, it’s fair to assume that we’ll likely see him focus on the 2022 ADCC weight class and absolute titles, where he could potentially win $10,000 for his weight division and $40,000 for the absolute.

188,Peaky Blinders season 6 release date: When is the BBC series back on?,2022-01-02,Fans got a new peek and Peaky Blinders' final series.,"Tommy is back soon… (Picture: BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd./Robert Viglasky) The new year started off with a bang for Peaky Blinders fans – or several bangs, as it were. A new trailer for season six was shared, and, judging by the 90-second teaser, the series shows no signs of easing up as fans are shown a clip of Cillian Murphy’s Tommy Shelby opening fire with a machine gun in the middle of a field at dusk. It’s been more than two years since season five of the gang-inspired drama aired its latest episode, which left viewers on a dramatic cliff-hanger. Leader of the Peaky Blinders, Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy), was seen pointing a gun at his head after having visions of his late wife Grace (Annabelle Wallis), with it not known whether the trigger was pulled. Previous trailers seemingly confirmed both the survival of Tommy and the return of Tom Hardy as Alfie Solomons. But when will the series be back on our screens at last? When is Peaky Blinders season 6 release date? While an exact release date is unknown, it has been revealed that the show is returning in early 2022. The latest glimpse of the upcoming season was released by the broadcaster on New Year’s Day, via the official Peaky Blinders social media accounts. One last deal to be done. Watch the final series of #PeakyBlinders, coming soon on @BBCOne and @BBCiPlayer. pic.twitter.com/abH8GYJdiu— Peaky Blinders (@ThePeakyBlinder) January 1, 2022 Many fans were expecting the latest tease to finally reveal the 2022 release date, alas it remained vague, similarly to the previous teasers for the show. The teaser also showed the return of The Queen’s Gambit actress Anya Taylor Joy as Michael Gray’s scheming wife Gina, as well teasing the impending threat of the rise of Nazism as the show moves closer to the start of the Second World War. Director Anthony Byrne posted a stylish countdown for the new teaser on his Instagram account but remained coy about a firm release date. https://www.instagram.com/tv/CYMnnDRoBQS/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link He previously revealed filming was over after cutting on the final episode late in 2021. Newcomer to the show Conrad Khan previously spoke to RadioTimes.com on when fans could expect another dose of the action. He said: ‘That comes out, from what I last heard – I mean, these things change so quickly – I think that will come out next February, the beginning of next year. ‘There was so much footage, so many episodes, that it does take a while to edit – six months or something.’ So it’s possible the show might come to screens in the first two months of 2022. Where will Peaky Blinders season 6 be available? Peaky Blinders will return to BBC iPlayer alongside airing on BBC One. It’s likely the series will air weekly on the broadcaster, with six episodes expected as usual. What else do we know about Peaky Blinders season 6? Cillian Murphy, Sam Clafin, and Paul Anderson will return to their roles, with other regular cast members expected to be back once more. However, some new faces will also be added in the Peaky Blinders Season 6 cast including Line of Duty star Stephen Graham and 21-year-old Conrad.

KOTA MARUDU, Jan 2 — The Sabah state government has the ability and capability to face threats like floods that are currently affecting the state, Minister in Prime Minister’s Department (Sabah and Sarawak Affairs) Datuk Seri Maximus Johnity Ongkili said.The Kota Marudu MP said that this was the result of close inter-agency ties, including the Social Welfare Department, the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma), the National Security Council (MKN) and security forces like the Royal Malaysian Police and the Fire and Rescue Department.“In Kota Marudu, I would like to thank the Social Welfare Department, Nadma and all security forces as I am very satisfied with their cooperation and assistance with flood evacuation efforts. Food and drink, everything is so organised right now.“The damage is extensive, but we will review the matter after other flood-related matters, including evacuation of those affected are completed,” he said after visiting a relief centre at St Theresa Church here, which is housing 142 evacuees.Ongkili said he was surprised by how sudden the floods hit Kota Marudu, after 200 milimetres of rainfall was recorded in a day, causing the water levels of Sungai Kanarom and Sungai Bandau to rise beyond their danger levels.Kota Marudu is the district with the highest number of flood evacuees, with 1,474 people from 520 families being housed in 11 relief centres.The number of evacuees in the state meanwhile, climbed to 1,832 people from 599 families as of 8 pm compared to 1,249 people from 432 families this evening. — Bernama","['maximus johnity ongkili', 'sabah floods 2021', 'malaysia floods 2021']",https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2022/01/02/minister-says-rapid-flood-response-in-sabah-result-of-close-inter-agency-ti/2032581,,malaymail

Fletcher called out popular entertainment for its gender-flipped reimagining’s of films and TV series, specifically citing “Doctor Who” along with “Star Wars” and “The Equalizer” among others. He said this has left young men with fewer positive screen role models and “is it any wonder we are seeing so many young men committing crimes” suggesting there’s a correlation. Those at the debate were left baffled, and now “Doctor Who” actress Jodie Whittaker has offered a diplomatic response when asked about it by Total TV Mag (via Twitter): “I think it’s on the one hand amusing and on the other unnerving. As much as I like to think the world revolves around me, I don’t think I have that much control. But there’s a sinister thing for me, and that is women being blamed for the actions of men. That is a very dangerous statement. I think women make excellent role models. Someone being replaced isn’t them being taken away. It’s broadening your horizons.” The quote comes as the first of Whittaker’s final three special episodes with her in the role has just aired. The actress has already shot her final scenes as The Doctor for the third special which is due sometime later this year. Her replacement has not yet been named. Finally, the briefest tease has been released for the second special titled “Legend of the Sea Devils” which sees the return of the iconic third Doctor villain several decades since they last appeared on the show. That episode will air in the Spring.

191,Leeds overcome Burnley for huge victory to ease relegation fears,2022-01-02,The post Leeds overcome Burnley for huge victory to ease relegation fears appeared first on TEAMtalk.,"Leeds United picked up a big three points as they overcame fellow relegation-threatened side Burnley at Elland Road. Defeat was a nightmare scenario for the Whites so Jack Harrison’s first-half strike was a relief. The Clarets struck back through Maxwel Cornet, but Stuart Dallas and Dan James netted to draw their side eight points clear of the drop zone. Marcelo Bielsa brought Junior Firpo and Diego Llorente into the Leeds side which were thumped 4-1 by Arsenal over two weeks ago. Sean Dyche, meanwhile, named an unchanged side from Thursday’s 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford. While both sides may have lacked in quality this season, they each started lively and with positive intent. Tyler Roberts was perhaps a little too hyped up, though, when he caught Matthew Lowton late and picked up an early booking. The forward showed better judgement to intercept and set up a counter-attack which resulted in a corner, from which Dallas forced a save from Nick Pope stand-in Wayne Hennessey. The goalkeeper was helpless when Raphinha attempted an audacious 40-yard lob which nearly crept under the crossbar. Firpo was next to have a shot saved before drawing a yellow-card challenge from James Tarkowski. Both sides had chances to take the lead with Chris Wood seeing his volley saved and an unmarked Roberts heading just wide. But it was the hosts who found the opener, with Harrison converting with his right after his initial left-footed attempted had been saved and rebounded to him. Leeds pushed for a second before the break. Burnley lost possession in their own half, allowing Raphinha to push forward and have a shot blocked. The subsequent corner ended with another shot which went over. Roberts also had a chance before the whistle. He capitalised on Ben Mee’s dawdling and fired straight at Hennessey. Burnley fight back after break Dyche made a half-time change, with Cornet returning from injury in place of Johaan Gudmundsson. And that substitution changed the game completely. The forward first got Llorente booked by referee by Paul Tierney. Then he curled a free-kick from 25 yards out past Illan Meslier in the Whites goal to level the match. In response, Bielsa made his own changes. Joe Gelhardt and James came on for Roberts and goalscorer Harrison. The fresh pair nearly combined for an instant impact. James’s cross nearly picked out his young team-mate, but Hennessey was out quickly to claim the ball. The visitors went close themselves when Ashley Westwood’s corner was flicked narrowly over the crossbar. Raphinha spurned a golden chance when a James cross found him free at the back post from where he hit the side-netting. But the Brazilian’s blushes were spared by Dallas, who precisely found the top-left corner with his shot from the edge of the box. Dyche made his remaining subs with Jay Rodriguez and Matej Vydra replacing Aaron Lennon and Wood. But it was Leeds who pushed forward and scored again in stoppage time when James headed home Gelhardt’s cross despite Hennessey’s best efforts to keep it out.

NEW YORK, Jan 2 — More than 3,000 flights were cancelled around the world today, more than half of them US flights, adding to the toll of holiday week travel disruptions due to adverse weather and the surge in coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant.Over 3,300 flights had been cancelled by noon GMT today, including over 1,900 entering, departing from or within the United States, according to a running tally on the tracking website FlightAware.com. Including those delayed but not cancelled, more than 4,800 flights were delayed in total.The Christmas and New Year holidays are typically a peak time for air travel, but the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant has led to a sharp increase in Covid-19 infections, forcing airlines to cancel flights as pilots and crew quarantine.Transportation agencies across the United States were also suspending or reducing services due to coronavirus-related staff shortages.Omicron has brought record case counts and dampened New Year festivities around much of the world.The rise in US Covid-19 cases had caused some companies to change plans to increase the number of employees working from their offices from tomorrow.Chevron Corp was to start a full return to office from January 3 but told employees in late December it was postponing the move indefinitely.US authorities registered at least 346,869 new coronavirus yesterday, according to a Reuters tally.

Many workers feared contracting Covid-19 and did not welcome the prospect of dealing with unruly passengers, some airline unions said.In the months preceding the holidays, airlines were wooing employees to ensure solid staffing, after furloughing or laying off thousands over the last 18 months as the pandemic hobbled the industry. — Reuters","['airlines', 'covid-19', 'global airlines industry', 'omicron coronavirus variant']",https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2022/01/02/airlines-grapple-with-omicron-related-disruptions-to-start-off-2022/2032580,,malaymail
193,‘Bob Hearts Abishola’ Fans Wonder if Christine Ebersole Really Had a Stroke,2022-01-02,"In ‘Bob Hearts Abishola,’ Christine Ebersole plays Dottie, who suffers a stroke in season 1, but she plays it so well, fans wonder if she had a stroke in real-life.","TV series like Chuck Lorre’s Bob Hearts Abishola on CBS run for years and years. It sometimes requires showrunners to adjust the story for health conditions and plans cast and crew might have. This caused fans to ask if the Bob Hearts Abishola Dottie actor, Christine Ebersole, really had a stroke in real life. Matt Jones and Christine Ebersole as Douglas and Dottie | Cliff Lipson/CBS via Getty Images Did the actor Christine Ebersole on ‘Bob Hearts Abishola’ really have a stroke? In Bob Hearts Abishola Season 1, Episode 6, Dottie suffered a massive stroke, leading to Abishola (Folake Olowofoyeku) caring for her. However, actor Christine Ebersole did not suffer a stroke in real life. She does play the part very convincingly, though. Ebersole does most of her acting in the show from a wheelchair. She talks out of half her mouth for much of the first two seasons, and she only has mobility in one arm. Caption this!My first scene with the lovely Christine Ebersole!Ready?! Tomorrow's a brand new episode of Bob Abishola on CBS. (Mondays at 8.30pm/7.30pm central.)#BobHeartsAbishola #ChristineEbersole #FolakeOlowofoyeku pic.twitter.com/sqabZ50dbv— Folake Olowofoyeku (@thefolake) November 4, 2019 The events serve as the catalyst that brings Bob and Abishola’s family together. Bob hires Abishola to care for Dottie and help her recovery process. During the time, Bob gets to know Abishola’s Auntie Olu (Shola Adewusi) and Uncle Tunde (Barry Shabaka Henley), who start rooting for Bob and Abishola. And of course, Dottie still manages to hold just as much power over her three children Bob, Christina (Maribeth Monroe), and Douglas (Matt Jones). As the founder of MaxDot, Dottie continues her involvement with the company despite her limitations. While Christine Ebersole did not suffer a stroke in real life, her recreation of the symptoms and recovery comes from a very real place. For Christine Ebersole, stroke symptoms are all too real to her According to the New York Post, Christine Ebersole plays a character suffering a stroke so convincingly because she has seen it for herself. “While many actors would have met with stroke survivors and medical professionals to research that infirmity, Ebersole had first-hand experience: her husband, Bill Moloney, suffered an acoustic neuroma 29 years ago, two years after they were married,” The Post reported in 2020. Ebersole talked about witnessing her husband going through the medical emergency in an interview. Officially retiring after taking this photo of Christine Ebersole and Kanye West. pic.twitter.com/wldm5z2sF0— David Gordon (@MrDavidGordon) December 3, 2018 “It’s a tumor in the inner ear pressing against the brain,” she told The Post. “He had a seven-hour surgery, and his whole left side became kind-of paralyzed. He was a drummer, and that really ended his career.” She recalled many aspects that she portrayed in the show with Abishola, Bob, Christina, and the rest of the cast. “He had to learn how to walk all over again, he couldn’t blink his eye,” she said, “he couldn’t smile. He still has a lot of facial pain because of nerve damage.” Dottie has some direct inspiration from Bill Moloney When Chuck Lorre asked Christine Ebersole to star on Bob Hearts Abishola, she decided to use the experience of Maloney’s stroke in her portrayal of Dottie. “It was all on his left side,” she said. “So I chose the left side [for Dottie]. I could relate to that. What I imagined was what Bill went through.” While she has spent Bob Hearts Abishola Season 1, 2, and 3 in a wheelchair, it could change soon. In the season 3 episode “Old Strokey,” Matt Jones’ Douglas witnesses her stand up briefly. She swore him to secrecy, but as these things usually go, the truth tends to come out in a big way.

Junior Firpo was in action for Leeds in their Premier League game against Burnley at Elland Road today. The former Barcelona left-back started as a left wing-back. And he played well. The 25-year-old was defensively solid and was also very good going on the attack. Leeds won 3-1. As you can see from the tweets below, Leeds fans were impressed by Junir Firpo’s performance against Burnley. Well, some of them anyway. Junior Firpo impresses Leeds United fans Photo by David Horton – CameraSport via Getty Images Thought Firpo was fantastic in that first half!!! Harrison needed that goal to help his confidence. Now I only a lot of @LUFC fans won't agree with me, but Roberts is fantastic in the middle, he's creative, holds the ball up well and can lay a pass off, but he's not a striker.— Danny (@Danny39098934) January 2, 2022 Firpo’s best game today by a mile; from an attacking and defending perspective. #LUFC— CW (@C1919W) January 2, 2022 I'm taking full credit for Firpo's resurgence today, said he was due a good game #lufc— Georgina Jane Petty (@orangina17) January 2, 2022 Firpo having a great game today.— DirtyLeeds&Proud!

Marcelo Bielsa’s side needed to win the match in order to enhance their chances of escaping the dreaded drop to the Championship at the end of the season. Leeds are not out of complete danger yet, but three points against a fellow relegation side will certainly enhance their confidence. In our opinion, Leeds were the better side against Burnley and deservedly picked up all three points from the encounter. Jack Harrison, Stuart Dallas and Daniel James scored the goals for Leeds.

196,‘Girl Meets Farm’: Molly Yeh Thanks Mom Jody for Inspiring her Recipe for Chocolate Sea Salt Rugelach,2022-01-02,"""Girl Meets Farm"" star Molly Yeh is thankful to her mom Jody for making Rugulach. Yeh updated her recipe to include a topping of flaky salt.","Girl Meets Farm star Molly Yeh has had a long love affair with the sweet treat Rugelach. The Food Network star has adored the rolled cookie since childhood. One of her most beloved food memories is watching her mom Jody make these traditional cookies, typically served around Chaunnakah. However, they are delectable any time of the year. Yeh thanked Jody for her recipe and tweaked the original just a bit to suit her adult palette. Molly Yeh | Discovery Press/Food Network What is Rugelach? Rugelach is a filled pastry cookie that originated in the Jewish communities of Poland. The word “Rugelach” is Yiddish, which means “little twists” and can be filled with various ingredients. Merriam-Webster defines it as “a pastry made with cream-cheese dough that is rolled around a filling (such as nuts, jam, or chocolate) and baked.” Molly Yeh shares her love for the sweet cookie Molly Yeh | Amanda Edwards/Getty Images for Discovery In a post shared on her website, My Name is Yeh, the Food Network personality explained her deep love for this rolled and baked delight. “Rugelach reminds me of my college days when my mom would send me huge care packages of it. I’d walk around to my friends’ practice rooms and pass them out, and we’d eat them together in the hallway. The arrival of “Jody’s arugula” [sic] became the perfect occasion to sit and commiserate about how hard playing the xylophone can be,” she revealed. “The recipe for this sea-salty chocolate rugelach is inspired by my mom’s,” she continued. “I love rugelach because the dough isn’t too sweet, and it’s just like a pie dough that’s been enriched with cream cheese. To help get those pie dough-like flakes, you want the ingredients to stay cold, and you don’t want to over-mix the dough (some clumps of butter and cream cheese are a good thing),” Yeh concluded. How to make Molly Yeh’s Chocolate Sea Salt Rugelach Molly Yeh makes Chocolate Rugelach on the “Rachael Ray Show” | YouTube/Rachael Ray Show The Chocolate Sea Salt Rugelach recipe contains many ingredients you may already have in your refrigerator. These include flour, sugar, kosher salt, unsalted butter, and cream cheese, Also needed are eggs, vanilla extract, almost extract, chocolate chips, and flaky salt. Combine the flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Add butter, then cream cheese. Mix until combined, followed by egg yolks, vanilla, and almond extract. Then halve the dough and refrigerate for at least one hour to chill. Melt chocolate in a double boiler, stirring constantly, or in a microwaveable bowl in 30-second increments. Allow to cool. Rolling, shaping and creating the cookies Beat one whole egg with water to make an egg wash. Roll out one-half of the dough until it forms a long wide rectangle. Then spread half of the chocolate out on the center of the dough in an even layer; leave an inch border around the sides. Brush border with egg wash, then roll up like a jelly roll into a tight log. Rest the log seam side down on a cutting board. Refrigerate again for one hour more. Remove from refrigerator and brush entire log with egg wash. Add flaky salt and sugar or sprinkles if you desire. Cut into 1-inch slices, and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for at least 20 minutes until they turn light brown on the top. Remove from oven and allow to cool. The full recipe is available on the Food Network website. Yeh prepared the Rachael Ray Show recipe, as seen in the video above. Girl Meets Farm airs Sundays at 11 a.m. EST on the Food Network.

That’s what happened when Katelyn Sutherland dressed up her toddler daughter, Jalayne, as Her Majesty for trick or treating. The inventive Ohio mom shared photos of her daughter, wearing a powder-blue, double-breasted coat and matching hat, accented by a grey wig and strand of pearls, with Jalayne posing with the family’s corgis. “The biggest inspiration for the outfit was the fact that our dogs are our daughter’s best friends,” Sutherland told the The Mirror of how she came up with the idea for the costume. “We wanted to do something where they could all be included together. We are most definitely fans of the Royal family and truly admire how the Queen walks by faith,” she added. “While walking around on Halloween we received many, many compliments but my favourite reactions were when people bowed to her or did the royal wave and said, ‘Your Majesty!'” READ MORE: The Queen Offers Touching Tribute To Late Husband Prince Philip In Annual Christmas Broadcast Sutherland sent some photos of the toddler to Buckingham Palace, never dreaming she’d receive a response — until she did. “The Queen wishes me to write and thank you for your letter, and for the photograph you thoughtfully enclosed,” reads a letter she received from the Hon Marry Morrison, the Queen’s Lady in Waiting. “Her Majesty thought it kind of you to write to her, and The Queen was pleased to see the photograph of your daughter, Jalayne, in her splendid outfit,” the letter — dated Dec. 9, 2021 — continued. “Her Majesty hopes you all have a very Merry Christmas, and I am enclosing a little information about the Royal Pets, which Jalayne might like to have.” Click to View Gallery The Queen’s Most Memorable Moments Next Slide",,https://etcanada.com/news/853463/the-queen-responds-to-toddler-who-dressed-as-her-for-halloween-praises-splendid-outfit/,,etcanada

203,Liverpool identify key trio forced to miss Chelsea clash due to Covid-19,2022-01-02,Jurgen Klopp - who is also positive for the virus - recently confirmed he would be without three men this weekend and it is now known who The post Liverpool identify key trio forced to miss Chelsea clash due to Covid-19 appeared first on TEAMtalk.,"Liverpool have named Alisson Becker, Joel Matip and Roberto Firmino as the three players to have recorded suspected positive Covid-19 tests. Jurgen Klopp – who is also positive and misses the game against Chelsea – confirmed at his pre-match press conference on Friday that he would be without three players for Sunday afternoon’s match. Their identities were not revealed at the time as the club were still awaiting PCR test confirmations. But now, a club statement has clarified the trio who are missing out. Goalkeeper Alisson, centre-back Matip and striker Firmino will play no part in the match against Chelsea. They are in isolation and have therefore not travelled for the game at Stamford Bridge. The club then provided clarity that the rest of the squad have tested negative. Caoimhin Kelleher will be starting in goal instead of Alisson. The centre-back pairing will be between Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate. Up front, Diogo Jota will continue alongside Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah. On Friday, Klopp said Liverpool’s Covid situation has been like a “lottery”. He said: “We never had this proper outbreak where 15 to 20 players had it. For us it is every day, another one, stuff happens more and more often. “It’s like a lottery in the morning, waiting for the result. It is pretty much day-by-day, always one case, then another one.” The absences will come as a blow to Liverpool’s title challenge. They are already 12 points behind leaders Manchester City, albeit with two games in hand. One of those is the clash with second-placed Chelsea at 4:30pm. They have still been able to field a strong lineup, though, so only time will tell how it affects them. From Van Dijk to Joelinton: Rating every Prem club’s record signing Liverpool sent Salah message Meanwhile, Liverpool have received some advice over the future of one of their players who is available, Mohamed Salah. The Egypt forward’s current deal expires in the summer of 2023. However, concerns over his long-term Anfield future have not stopped Salah having a stellar season so far, with the 29-year-old notching 22 goals and adding nine assists in 25 games in all competitions for the Reds. However, Micah Richards believes the Reds forward can get even better in 2022 – prompting Liverpool to get a new deal done asap. “I want Liverpool to finalise a new contract for him and I want him to stay in the Premier League for many more years,” the former Manchester City defender wrote in the Daily Mail. “He is getting to the level now where we are talking about him being in the Premier League’s Hall of Fame, someone who could be in the all-time team. “What a player he has become. He is so dangerous that in some matches you don’t see him for 80 minutes but then he will pop up with a goal or an assist. It’s not luck that happens. “He’s at Cristiano Ronaldo levels now, the one-time winger who has redefined himself to become an ultimate scorer. “If 2021 was spectacular for Salah, 2022 can be even more so. He looks a certainty at this stage to win the PFA Player of the Year but if Liverpool were to win the Champions League, he will also have an outstanding chance of lifting the Ballon d’Or.” READ MORE: Klopp shares ‘funny story’ of ‘video’ made for Liverpool star in spotlight for wrong reasons The post Liverpool identify key trio forced to miss Chelsea clash due to Covid-19 appeared first on TEAMtalk.","['English Premier League', 'All The News', 'More News', 'Front Page', 'Homepage', 'Liverpool', 'Roberto Firmino', 'Joel Matip', 'Alisson Becker']",https://www.teamtalk.com/news/alisson-matip-firmino-forced-miss-chelsea-clash-covid-19,,teamtalk
204,Asmongold roasts Square Enix pushing Metaverse and NFTs: “People don’t give a f**k,2022-01-02,Twitch star Asmongold mocked games company Square Enix who praised both the Metaverse and NFTs as plans for the future of their business. The post Asmongold roasts Square Enix pushing Metaverse and NFTs: “People don’t give a f**k appeared first on Dexerto.,"Twitch star Asmongold has hit out at Square Enix’s recent New Years’ statement, in which the company called 2021 “Metaverse and NFTs: Year One”, and praised the potential of the new technology. Asmongold is one of the big streamers on Twitch who is not afraid to hold back his opinion when he feels strongly about a topic. He’s hit out at Activision Blizzard and YouTube in the past, and more recently, has been open in his criticisms of NFTs, or Non-fungible Tokens, having called people who spend thousands on them “ridiculous.” After Square Enix declared 2021 as “Year One” for the surge of the Metaverse and NFTs , Asmon took to Twitch to share how he feels about the company’s messaging on the topic. Asmongold has over 2.4 million followers on Twitch. Asmongold on the Metaverse and NFTs The streamer was live on his secondary channel that he’s been using, zackrawrr, when he read the Square Enix letter to his audience. Read More: Asmongold calls out FFXIV ‘purists’ who claim he secretly hates the game He touched on his thoughts about the Metaverse and said, “People aren’t really talking a whole lot about the Metaverse, they’re not thinking about it. The main people that are pushing the idea of the Metaverse are the corporate overlords that are looking to sequester and segment away more autonomy of your personal life away from you, and into the realm that they can control, that is being called the Metaverse.” Asmongold then asked his viewership to “Do not fall victim to this language. Do not be taken advantage of. This is something that’s being pushed from the top-down, this is something many people don’t give a f**k about.” ﻿ He also touched on his thoughts about NFTs, and said: “I think that the idea of it is interesting. However, what’s produced with it is not. It’s kind of like the idea of printer, it’s amazing, you don’t need a printing press anymore with a digital printer. But, whenever the digital printer prints out a picture of a banana, it’s not worth anything.” ﻿ Asmon finished by hilariously mocking the tokens, “‘It was made by this incredible technology! Look at the capabilities! Oh My God! Wow!’ Like, yeah, that’s super cool, but all you have is a sheet of paper with a banana on it.” While he shared optimism about the potential of new technology in the gaming space, Asmongold doesn’t see the value in it just yet.

207,Eternals Director Chloé Zhao: Harry Styles and Eros Were a Package Deal,2022-01-02,Marvel Studios’ Eternals introduced a handful of brand-new characters into […] The post Eternals Director Chloé Zhao: Harry Styles and Eros Were a Package Deal appeared first on ComingSoon.net.,"Marvel Studios’ Eternals introduced a handful of brand-new characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, during the post-credits scene for the film, two more characters were introduced, and director/writer Chloé Zhao recently explained how they arrived in the film. RELATED: Chloé Zhao Details Eternals’ Bleak Original Ending For those unaware, during the post-credits scene in Eternals, Eros — played by Harry Styles — and his partner, Pip, showed up on the Eternals ship, offering their assistance. Eros’ introduction into the MCU is a big deal, as he’s not only another Eternal but also the brother of Thanos, the Mad Titan that acted as the overarching bad guy for the first decade of MCU films. Speaking to Empire Magazine in a recent interview, Zhao explained that she had always wanted to bring Eros into the MCU with the film, and, in her own mind, theorized how Eros being stationed on Titan could have affected not only his own mind but the mind of his brother as well. “Long story short, with that depressing ending, at some point he was going to be one of the Eternals on that ship,” Zhao said, referencing the original ending to the film she had in mind. “And that didn’t quite work out. But I had been wanting to bring Eros into the MCU. So I kept mentioning it to Kevin [Feige] at every chance I had in the hallway because I love the idea of Eros being another Eternal, another Ajak. He’s an Eternal, and he was stationed on Titan – 10 of them were, just like the 10 Eternals on Earth, assuming Titan is also a host planet at some point. Now, if you think about that, what influence could Eros have had on the inhabitants of Titan, the way Ajak has influenced people on Earth? And how that has affected Thanos?” Zhao went on to talk about how the Eternals comics offer a much deeper, “quite beautiful” insight into the relationship between Eros and Thanos, and that’s something that spoke to her. She also touched on his partner, Pip, likening the pair to Han Solo and Chewbacca from the Star Wars universe. RELATED: Disney+ January 2022 Schedule: Movies and TV Titles Revealed “If you go to the comics, there’s some quite beautiful, heartbreaking influence Eros has had on Thanos,” Zhao said. “And how much does Thanos know? I love him as a character. It makes my imagination go crazy thinking, ‘Why does Thanos think this way? Why is he worried about overpopulation and destroying his planet?’ Think about the emergence – does Eros know about it? Maybe if he’s an advisor, the way Ajak advised kings and queens on Earth? It gets my imagination going. “For me, the backstory of Eros is that he deserted, he said, ‘I’m not doing this anymore.’ So he somehow got that sphere, which you saw in his hand, and he ran off and made Pip the troll. They’re like Han Solo and Chewie. Arishem’s been looking for him, and he’s just been a space outlaw. That’s the character I had in my mind. But I never said once to Kevin, ‘Here’s the character. Let’s find an actor.’ For me, it was a package deal. It’s got to be Harry. That’s how I pitched it to Kevin.” The post Eternals Director Chloé Zhao: Harry Styles and Eros Were a Package Deal appeared first on ComingSoon.net.","['Action', 'Comic Book', 'Movies', 'chloe zhao', 'Disney', 'disney plus', 'Harry Styles', 'Marvel', 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', 'marvel studios', 'Movie News', 'streaming']",https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/1206383-chloe-zhao-eros-eternals-harry-styles,,comingsoon

Kirito remains a pillar within the fandom, and of course, the same can be said for Asuna. After all their time spent together, Sword Art Online is exploring the couple with new light novels, manga volumes, and films. And in the wake of the new year, well - Sword Art Online fans are eyeing the two and their series extra hard.And why is that, you might be asking? Well, it all has to do with 2022. If you didn't know, the original series was set in the year 2022, so fans are rightfully freaking out. Link start... pic.twitter.com/iGcgT7Vea4-- Anime Corner (@animecorner_ac) January 2, 2022 The whole conversation came about naturally as the new year rung in yesterday. As midnight struck on 2021, a new year was welcomed with many hoping for a better 2022. But if you happen to be a fan of Sword Art Online, you know this year has been bungled before. In the anime, 2022 marked the start of Kirito's hero quest, and it changed his life for good. If you look back in Sword Art Online, 2022 ushered the release of the NerveGear that May after the sophisticated VR tech was released. By August, the Sword Art Online game went into its Closed beta before the game launched in full that November. And not long after the game launched, Kirito and 10,000 players were trapped inside Sword Art Online following a cyber attack. More than 200 died that day alone and more would follow as players who died in the game would follow in real life. Clearly, 2022 was a wild year in the Sword Art Online universe, but it didn't go south until November came around. At the start, things seemed great as new VR tech was made public, and the future of gaming expanded its horizons. In our real world, much the same can be said thanks to innovations from Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. But when it comes to VR, well - we are nowhere near ready to launch a console as complicated as the NerveGear. Honestly, that is probably for the best given how the tech was used in Sword Art Online. So if you are set on exploring VR this year, may we recommend the Oculus or HTC Vive. {replyCount}commentsWhat do you make of the new year's connection to Sword Art Online?

The World Health Organization warned Wednesday that the world will soon see a “tsunami of cases” of COVID-19 throughout the winter. | Nam Y. Huh, Associated Press The omicron variant continues to spread across the United States The World Health Organization warned Wednesday that the world will soon see a “tsunami of cases” of COVID-19 which will stretch throughout the winter. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director-general, said the highly transmissible omicron variant and the fast-spreading delta variant will lead to the surge of cases, per The Financial Times. “This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Tedros said. The WHO director-general warned that the omicron variant can be really dangerous because of hospitalizations. Early research has found the omicron variant has led to less severe COVID-19 symptoms and hospitalizations among the fully vaccinated, as I wrote for the Deseret News. But that doesn’t mean hospitalizations and deaths will stop overall. “There is this narrative going on which is ‘it’s milder or less severe,’” Tedros said. “But we’re undermining the other side, at the same time it could be dangerous, because the high transmissibility could increase hospitalizations and deaths.” Per The Economist, the omicron variant has such high transmissibility that it could lead to more hospitalizations and deaths, which could destroy the hospital system. “Once someone is so sick as to require hospital treatment, doctors may have fewer options available for omicron than for its antecedents,” according to The Economist. “Previous strains could often be treated with drugs called monoclonal antibodies. Omicron seems oblivious to most of these, and supplies of those that do affect it, newly developed versions ... are limited.”",,https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2022/1/2/22858983/omicron-variant-cases-delta-variant-who-warns,,deseret

We have mobilised a team from the Banting fire station to help evacuate affected residents. The public is also advised to leave their homes if floodwaters rise,” he said when contacted.He said the department has yet to receive any flood-related distress calls from other areas in Selangor, adding that the situation in Taman Seri Nanding in Hulu Langat and Shah Alam which were badly hit by floods recently were still under control.Earlier, MetMalaysia had issued a continuous rain warning at dangerous, severe and alert levels in most areas in the country until Tuesday (Jan 4).They involve the states of Johor, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Melaka, Sabah, Kelantan, Terengganu, Perak, and Selangor; and the Federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. — Bernama","['pahang floods', 'sabah floods', 'johor floods', 'melaka floods', 'malaysia floods 2021']",https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2022/01/02/floods-worsen-as-number-of-evacuees-rise-in-melaka-johor-pahang-and-sabah/2032579,,malaymail

NEW YORK, Jan 2 — More than 3,600 flights were cancelled around the world today, more than half of them US flights, adding to the toll of holiday week travel disruptions due to adverse weather and the surge in coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant.Over 3,600 flights had been cancelled by afternoon GMT today, including over 2,100 entering, departing from or within the United States, according to a running tally on the tracking website FlightAware.com.

Some are planning to vastly ramp up virus testing among students and staff. And a small number of school systems are switching to remote learning — for just a short while, educators hope. With coronavirus infections soaring, the return from schools’ winter break will be different than planned for some as administrators again tweak protocols and make real-time adjustments in response to the shifting pandemic. All are signaling a need to stay flexible. “Change has been the only constant in this fight,” Newark Schools Superintendent Roger León wrote in a notice to parents before break. He announced Thursday that students will learn remotely for at least the first two weeks of the new year. The virus, León said, continues “to be a brutal, relentless and ruthless virus that rears its ugly head at inopportune times.” Long after the widespread closures in the pandemic's early days, school and elected leaders say they are using the lessons and tools of the past two years to try to navigate the latest surge without long-term shutdowns, which had woeful effects on learning and students' well-being. Still, pressure from parents and teachers unions has added to the urgency surrounding safety measures as the omicron-fueled surge sends up caseloads and puts children in the hospital in close to record numbers. “They say kids do well (if infected), but who's to say my kid is not going to be that one,” said Rebecca Caldwell, who is considering petitioning her Charleston, Illinois, district for a remote option that would let her keep her four sons, ages 17, 10, 7 and 5, home through the winter. The first half of the school year brought Caldwell's family three scares from exposures. One, from a family member, kept the whole family in quarantine for 10 days. Her 17-year-old and 10-year-old saw classmates infected, and each underwent a nerve-wracking series of COVID-19 tests as part of a more recent “test-to-stay” policy. “It's really scary because you worry about the domino effect, too,” said Caldwell, whose own health issues led her to leave her restaurant job more than a year ago to lessen her risk. In the nation's largest school system, New York City, 2 million at-home test kits provided by the state will be used to increase testing following the break, officials announced this week. Students whose classmates test positive can keep coming to school as long as their at-home tests are negative and they don’t have symptoms. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents New York City educators, questioned whether the new testing initiatives will be available in every school by the time schools reopen Monday. “We are moving closer to a safe reopening of school next week. But we are not there yet,“ he said. In Chicago, the nation's third-largest school district, officials announced the purchase of 100,000 laptops over the holidays in case they are needed for remote learning in January, though district leaders said they hope to avoid a system-wide closure. The Chicago Teachers Union has proposed pausing in-person learning unless new safety measures are introduced, including negative COVID tests for returning students. To help keep as many students in school as possible, the Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona endorsed test-to-stay in December as an alternative to the previously recommended 10-day quarantines. Hundreds of schools have adopted test-to-stay policies for students who have had contact with an infected classmate. “The goal remains to keep all schools open for in-person learning five days a week throughout the 2021-22 school year and beyond,” Cardona said in a message to schools marking the halfway point of the academic year. He said 99% of schools were open in-person in December, compared with 46% last January. Out of more than 13,000 school districts nationwide, relatively few have announced plans to start remotely after winter break. Like Newark, those districts generally plan to resume in-person instruction within a couple weeks. They include Cleveland, Ohio; Prince George’s County, Maryland; Mount Vernon, New York; Taos, New Mexico; Chester County, South Carolina; and several New Jersey school systems. Citing the city's high infection rate, Detroit Superintendent Nikolai Vitti on Friday extended the winter break for nearly 50,000 students through at least Jan. 5 and urged them to get tested through the district. Tests are required for employees. Ronald Taylor, superintendent of the South Orange-Maplewood School District in New Jersey, said a spike in cases and subsequent quarantining heading into the break had disrupted operations by forcing consolidation of classes where there weren’t enough staff. He said the district would be remote the first week back. “Like many other school districts, we have seen a consistent trend, after each of our school breaks, both Thanksgiving and our fall break in early November, there has been a sharp increase in our student/staff population of COVID cases,” he said. Masks also will make a return in some districts after break, including Hopkinton High School, the first Massachusetts public school to lift the mandate, in October. It was reinstated just before break. In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, where one in four people was testing positive for the virus, the school system announced Thursday that all employees, volunteers and visitors will be required to wear face coverings at schools and facilities, and students will be strongly encouraged to wear them. A state law prevents school districts from imposing mask mandates for students. Some school systems are moving toward requiring vaccinations for students, but not anytime soon. In the Los Angeles school district, which was among the first to announce mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for students, a Jan. 10 deadline for students 12 and older was postponed until fall of 2022. Officials said the earlier date would have barred about 27,000 unvaccinated students from campuses. The District of Columbia on Dec. 22 said all students, whether in public, private or charter schools, must be fully vaccinated by March 1. Much about the omicron coronavirus variant remains unknown, including whether it causes more or less severe illness. Scientists say omicron spreads even easier than other coronavirus strains, including delta, and it is expected to become dominant in the U.S. by early 2022. In Ohio, where hospitalizations for COVID-19 hit a record high this week, the Ohio Hospital Association is asking schools statewide to consider mandatory mask wearing as cases continue to spike. The patchwork of responses also includes Woodbury, New Jersey's plans to bring students in for half days for the first week, sending them home with lunch so they don't have to remove masks in the building to eat.","['Coronavirus', 'Nation/world', 'News']",https://ktla.com/news/coronavirus/u-s-schools-adapt-for-return-from-holiday-break-as-covid-19-cases-surge/,,ktla

The Scottish Daily Mail (01/01, back page) suggested that Rangers have now made contact with Bologna over signing Skov Olsen. Bologna Sport News now claim that Skov Olsen has offers on the table from Sampdoria and Rangers. That report notes that Skov Olsen will decide his next team in the coming days as he seeks a move early into January. Half-Season Team of the Season & Awards | HITC Sevens Christmas SpecialBridTV7493Half-Season Team of the Season & Awards | HITC Sevens Christmas Special930141930141center13872 Rangers have been linked with Skov Olsen for some time, and they will now hope to beat Sampdoria to his signature. Olsen can be Van Bronckhorst’s new Berghuis at Rangers One of the great success stories in Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s time at Feyenoord was Steven Berghuis. After barely featuring at Watford, Berghuis became a star under Van Bronckhorst. Photo by Gianluca Ricci/LiveMedia/NurPhoto via Getty Images With 44 goals and 37 assists in 120 games under Van Bronckhorst, Berghuis was one of the now-Rangers manager’s key players. You can see parallels between Berghuis and Skov Olsen. Both are fairly tall wingers, standing at over 6ft tall. Both predominantly play down the right flank, cutting inside on their stronger left sides, or can feature as number 10’s. Having that left-footed threat in from the right side is important to Van Bronckhorst, and Olsen could do that for Rangers – if they can get a deal done.

The Albert Park Circuit in Australia made its debut on the F1 calendar in 1996 as a replacement for Adelaide. Since then the circuit never got a chance to make upgrades until 2019. The pandemic shutdown gave the opportunity to upgrade the track and facilities with a much faster track layout. F1 will return to Australia in April 2022. Boss of the Australian GP corporation, Andrew Westacott believes that these major upgrades will ensure F1’s return beyond the contract. The countdown is well & truly on! Only 100 days until #F1 returns to @Melbourne for the #AusGP pic.twitter.com/oCaN9WZQNN — F1 Australian Grand Prix (@ausgrandprix) December 28, 2021 “When you’re doing the track modifications that we’ve done, which is about $20 million worth, you don’t do those just for the three or four years. I say three because the contract goes out to 2025, so it’s actually this year plus another three,” Westacott told Speedcafe.com. “We’ve always got an eye to the future, and in the world of Formula 1 and MotoGP, you’ve really got to be looking to that future.” “There’s nothing other than optimism and ongoing dialogue that we always have with people,” he further added. Also Read: Did you know Lewis Hamilton was also a wrestler in Lucha Libre Wrestling? Australian GP has targeted more overtaking Westacott further suggested that contract negotiations are underway. He said, “I’ve always held the view with F1 and Dorna at MotoGP is you’re starting the contract negotiations the minute you ink the previous one.” “You’ve got to be continuously developing your facilities, the track, and also the entertainment and the programme you put on. When you look at what Zandvoort has done, and Mexico, and what Miami will probably do, we’ve got to make sure we’re up the front of the pack.” “The intent of it is to make the racing more exciting,” he further added. He also gave some details of the modified track. The second sector of the lap on the circuit would be fearsomely fast. Other corners have also been expanded as necessary to increase the chances of overtaking. Since 1995, fresh asphalt has also been laid down. But Westacott felt that just a simple refresh would not be enough. Therefore, they have made some subtle changes to camber, asphalt mix, took out a chicane and also widened the pit lane. He explained that the combination of some parts of the track is designed to introduce a more tyre strategy.

The post Retired boxer Tony Bellew slams Jake Paul’s 2022 goals as a “disgrace” appeared first on Dexerto.","Former professional boxer Tony Bellew roasted YouTuber Jake Paul for his 2022 goals, which included some thinly-veiled digs at the sport of boxing. Since KSI and Joe Weller stepped into the ring to fight one another back in 2018, YouTube boxing has exploded in popularity. Jake Paul has been a big part of that, fighting Nate Robinson, Ben Askren, and, most recently, Tyron Woodley. In typically confident fashion, Jake ushered in the new year by laying a series of challenges at the feet of Dana White, the President of the UFC. He followed up his audacious remarks with an equally bold list of his 2022 goals which, amongst others, included “going to [a] chiropractor to heal back from carrying the sport of boxing”. Some people are asking about my 2022 goals Here they are 1. Buy Mayweather Promotions and save them from bankruptcy 2. Hire stylist for Floyd Mayweather 3. Take selfie with Oprah 4. Go 2 chiropractor 2 heal back from carrying the sport of boxing — Jake Paul (@jakepaul) December 31, 2021 Naturally, his comments attracted some high-profile responses, not least from retired English boxer Tony Bellew, who once held the WBC Cruiserweight title.

I don’t have time for that,” he said. “However to say he’s carrying our amazing sport and hasn’t boxed 1 actual boxer yet is a disgrace! He’s not a boxer until he beats a registered/ranked boxer..

Lukaku – who returned to Chelsea in a £97million deal from Inter Milan in the summer – revealed he was unhappy with his situation at Chelsea in an interview recorded with Sky Italia a few weeks ago but released this week. READ MORE: The Mailbox has got a case of the BT Sports The Belgian was dropped from the Chelsea squad to face Liverpool on Sunday after Tuchel admitted his frustration with his player’s comments. Carragher likened Tuchel’s decision to omit Lukaku to the shows of strength of Mikel Arteta at Arsenal this season and claimed that although players have often prevailed over managers at Stamford Bridge in the past, the Blues should stick by Tuchel and instead allow Lukaku to leave the club if it came to it. “I admire what Mikel Arteta has done with Aubameyang and in some ways I admire Tuchel here,” he told Sky Sports. “Let’s not forget this club. This is a different club, the players have always won against the manager. “Right now, I think in terms of top managers around in world football, I would say we have three in the Premier League in Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel. “Look at the problems, Manchester United have right now – they still don’t know who they’re going to get at the end of the season. “I actually think right now – even though they’ve had great success changing managers over the last ten years – I think it would be easier for them to replace Lukaku then the manager they’ve got. “Because they’ve got a proper top class manager right now.” Another Liverpool legend, Graeme Souness, said that Lukaku was out of order with his comments. “This guy has more than crossed the line,” he said. “He has to apologise to his teammates. “Someone in the dressing room has come up with that nonsense when we were players, how do you think we would have reacted? “It’s so offside it beggars belief.”   The post Carragher urges Chelsea to replace Lukaku over Tuchel appeared first on Football365.","['All The News', 'Chelsea', 'Home Page', 'News', 'Promos', 'jamie carragher', 'Romelu Lukaku', 'thomas tuchel']",https://www.football365.com/news/carragher-chelsea-replace-lukaku-over-tuchel,,football365

The Dutchman has struggled for game time in recent months and there has been plenty of specualtion he could look to leave on loan during the January transfer window. Van de Beek has only started one match since Rangnick took charge but he has pleaded with the midfielder to stay on until the summer and hopes to be able to hand him more minutes ahead of the World Cup. ‘So far as I have got to know him he’s got a top mentality, he works hard in every training session,’ Rangnick said. ‘He’s a team player through and through and there will be games where he will get his chance to play I’m sure. ‘I also had a longer conversation with him last week about that and of course it’s difficult for him right now because he also wants to play for the Dutch national team. ‘He wants to…play in the World Cup in Qatar and in order to do that he needs to get game-time here.

Suffering from knee pain which he attributes to training too hard, too soon after his offseason break, the Briton says he will have to take a full week off the bike.Froome, a four-time Tour de France winner, explained on his personal YouTube channel that he is having pain caused by inflammation of his tensor fascia latae, a small muscle that attaches to the iliotibial band and is involved in hip flexion, abduction, and internal rotation as well as knee flexion and lateral rotation - movements that are all crucial for cycling. Read moreChris Froome: I've still got a few more years of racing to come Chris Froome: Suffering has given me more perspective about my career and life Chris Froome invests in Factor Bikes ""For the last ten days or so I've been getting quite a lot of pain on the outside of my knee while I'm pedaling,"" Froome says while touching his right knee. It is the same leg where he fractured the femur in his dramatic crash while reconnoitering the Critérium du Dauphiné time trial in 2019.""The scans have basically shown that I've damaged my TFL tendon (sic), which is where the IT band connects on the side of the knee.""Unfortunately I think getting back into training these past couple of weeks I might have been a little bit too keen, pushing a little too much. This was after a few weeks off the bike and maybe the body wasn't ready to push that hard. It's flared up and caused a bit of inflammation.""Froome has not been able to get back to the level that won him seven Grand Tours since his crash but the 36-year-old said he hoped to get back to a competitive level in 2022.The knee injury will keep Froome from ramping up his training for the next few weeks, and has made his early season racing plans uncertain.""It's quite sensitive. I have to take the best part of a week off the bike completely before starting very gradually without loading it for the best part of two to three weeks after that,"" Froome says.""It's definitely a setback for me. I'm not too sure where I'm going to start the racing season. This is definitely going to push everything back slightly.""It's unfortunate but I'm going to have to make the best of it and keep working on things that I can work on off the bike - make sure to do a lot of core work, strengthening muscles I can work on without stressing that tendon further.""",,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/froomes-training-for-2022-halted-by-knee-injury/,,cyclingnews

Credit ITV / Getty The Masked Singer is back and so are the judges – Davina McCall, Jonathan Ross, Mo Gilligan, and Rita Ora, who had their notepads and pends ready last night to figure out the celebs behind the masks. Season 3 kicked off with a bang, as contestants including Firework, Mushroom, Doughnuts and Robobunny sang their hearts out in a bid to make it through to the next round. The first episode finished with Chandelier being unmasked and revealed to be none other than Heather Small, who had the judges completely fooled as she disguised her distinctive voice. Naturally, Twitter was alight with speculation as viewers threw names around like Gary Lineker and Jodie Whittaker for who they thought was underneath the elaborate costumes. Judge Rita Ora had some of her own wild guesses, earning dead silence followed by laughter from the studio audience by suggesting Lion Fish could be Ellen Degeneres. With the new season in full swing now, let’s get to know more-a about Rita Ora. Rita is back on our screens on The Masked Singer panel (Picture: ITV) Where is Rita Ora from? The Your Song hitmaker was born in 1990 in Prishtina, Kosovo to Albanian parents. She also has an older sister, Elena, and a younger brother, Don. Rita moved to London in the following year after her family left Kosovo for political reasons. They settled in England in 1991, and Rita grew up in Notting Hill in West London. She attended performing arts school, Sylvia Young Theatre School before beginning her singing career by performing at open mic sessions around the capital. Rita is the reigning champ on the singing show (Picture: ITV) Who is Rita Ora’s boyfriend? The Hot Right Now songstress is currently dating New Zealand director Taika Waititi, 46. The couple began dating in March 2021 after meeting in Australia last February while Rita was filming The Voice Australia. The Oscar-winning filmmaker was previously married to film producer Chelsea Winstanley, but the pair supposedly split in 2018. He shares two daughters with Chelsea – Te Hinekāhu, nine, and Matewa Kiritapu, seven.   The couple made their red carpet debut at the LA premiere of The Suicide Squad last August. Rita recently told The Kyle and Jackie O Show that she is in a ‘very happy place’ with Taika. The songwriter and filmmaker are currently all loved up (Picture: Kevin Mazur) Who else has Rita Ora dated?

246,"Children need two hours of outdoor play a day, even in winter, says parenting expert",2022-01-02,Give it a try.,"Here’s a New Year’s resolution for you: aim for two hours a day outside (Picture: Getty / Metro.co.uk When’s the last time you popped outside and felt the fresh air on your face, the wind on your skin? What about your kids? Have they come up for air in between the hours playing on whatever console they got for Christmas? If it’s been a while since you or your children spent some time out in nature, you’re certainly not alone. And please don’t beat yourself up for this oh-so-common slip-up. But Joanna Fortune, psychotherapist and author of the 15-Minute Parenting books, encourages parents and carers to at least try to get back on track and get the kids outside every day in 2022 – ideally for at least two hours. We know, we know, that sounds like quite a lot. But Joanna reckons the benefits far outweigh the stress of initially convincing your kids to switch off the TV and exit the living room. She says that spending time playing outdoors in nature can help to lower anxiety levels and decrease hyperactivity. ‘Spending much of their day in school in a building with walls, it is really important and beneficial that children get to spend as much time as possible outdoors,’ says Joanna. ‘Young children need two to three hours of physical outdoor play per day and many are not getting it. It helps them to learn, process and burn off energy. Explore the great outdoors (Picture: Getty Images) ‘The great outdoors provides space with far fewer physical restrictions than indoor environments and this allows children to express themselves more openly. ‘Adequate time outdoors reduces anxiety and hyperactivity, boosts mood and builds collaborative play skills and teamwork. ‘When children are happier and more relaxed, alert and attuned, they are more open to learning.’ This way of thinking is why Koru Kids childcare agency launched Home Nursery, offering childminders who will immerse children aged six months to four years in outdoor adventure. Those in this type of care count sticks, stones and leaves, chalk letters onto paving, and learn how to safely climb tree stumps. That all sounds lovely, but if, like the majority of parents, you can’t afford to send your kids off to enjoy an outdoorsy take on a curriculum, you can still take these lessons and apply them for free in your own time. That’s where aiming to spend a bit more time out in nature comes in. And the good news is that going outside with the kids will benefit adults, too. Leaves: fun for all the family (Picture: Getty Images) ‘Children benefit greatly by getting to run, jump, climb and play outdoors breathing a different air in a fresh environment,’ says Joanna. ‘One of the best ways we have to reset a busy, agitated and overwhelmed brain is to change our field of vision. ‘A quick way to achieve that – for adults as well – is to turn away from your screen and look out of a window.’ While two hours a day might be ideal, remember that any time spent outdoors can deliver benefits, so see how you can fit in some immersion in nature around your schedule. This doesn’t have to mean going out on an all-day hike or taking up birdwatching. Joanna recommends simply looking out of the window while you’re working from home, or reading your book outside in the garden rather than on the sofa. ‘Name five things that you can see, four things that you can hear, three things that you can touch, two things that you can smell and one thing that you can taste,’ she suggests.

For adults that may mean taking the hot cup of tea and standing outdoors to drink it. ‘As your mind wanders, use the bird practice: Every time you see or hear a bird say “I see/hear a bird” as a way of pulling yourself from spiralling thoughts into the now moment.’ Sounds a bit more doable, right? If you need some ideas to get you started, Joanna suggests… Ways to get outdoors with your children: Assign a patch of your garden to your child to dig, plant and create. Bury something and let them dig for treasure. Go to a green space and play tag, bring some pavement chalk and find a suitable space to do patio art or draw hopscotch and play that. Play at spinning around really fast and flopping down on grass to do some cloud gazing, imaging what you can find in the cloud shapes. Two of you hold a rope while a third jumps in the middle. With older children make this more challenging by giving each person a turn in the middle BUT they must hold a paper cup of water while they jump 10 times – the winner is the person with the most water left in their cup at the end. Play with the seasons and gather up leaves in Autumn to make leaf art. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.

We do not think that the Blues will sell the striker after just one season. Even if Chelsea decide to move on the 28-year-old, then they are not going to sell him for anything less than the £97.5 million that they signed him for. Would Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy be prepared to spend that much money on a striker who will be 29 in May? We do not think so.

The Uruguay international will be out of contract next summer and Barcelona have explored the possibility of signing the striker in the January transfer window. Cavani has started just three games in the Premier League this season due to injury but Rangnick is adamant that the 34-year-old is a ”highly important player’ for United. ‘We have had quite a few conversations over the last couple of weeks, probably the player with whom I have spoken the most,’ said Rangnick. ‘I told him from the very first day he is a highly important player, he is probably the only one who can play as a striker back to goal and face to goal. ‘And as I said, his professionalism and his work ethic is just amazing.

Tkachenko took fault with the series' portrayal of a Ukrainian character, calling it ""unacceptable."" He noted that the character, Petra, was portrayed as someone who steals and fears deportation. A politician called out Netflix's ""Emily in Paris"" over its portrayal of a Ukrainian character, saying it's ""unacceptable"" and ""offensive."" Season 2 of ""Emily in Paris,"" which stars Lily Collins as the titular character, premiered on December 22 but has already ruffled some feathers. The series previously got flack from fans who believed ""Emily in Paris"" lacked diversity and stereotyped cultures.Oleksandr Tkachenko, Ukraine's Minister of Culture and Information Policy, pointed to a character named Petra, who at one point during the series tricks Emily into stealing clothes and accessories from a store. ""In the 1990s and 2000s, Ukrainian guys were portrayed mainly as gangsters. Over time this has changed. However, not in this case,"" Tkachenko said, according to The Mirror. He continued: ""In Emily in Paris we have a caricature of a Ukrainian woman which is unacceptable. It is also offensive. Is this how Ukrainians will be seen abroad? Who steal, want to get everything for free, be afraid of deportation? This should not be so."" Season 2 of ""Emily in Paris"" included a Ukrainian character named Petra.STÉPHANIE BRANCHU/NETFLIXThe Mirror reported that researcher Olga Matveieva also chimed in, saying it was a shame that Petra ""marginalises the image of an average Ukrainian woman.""""Nationality-based stereotyping not only provokes disbalance but maintains aggression.

Paris is one of the most diverse cities in the world,"" he said. ""We have so many ways of thinking, so many different nationalities, so many different neighborhoods.

A total of 1,028 mobile towers were affected which caused difficulty for flood victims to communicate. Most of these sites were down because of power outages or damaged equipment due to rising water levels. To mitigate such problems in the future, the Communications and Multimedia Ministry has suggested building higher platforms of around 3 metres for towers affected by the recent floods. He said this is to reduce damage to telco towers and to ensure that communications would not be cut off in the event of a disaster. Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa has asked the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to take the initiative to ensure telco towers at flood-prone areas would not have equipment at the ground level in the future. Annuar Musa said communications should not be cut off even if water rises to 10 feet or even after floods recede. He said even those who are trapped on the rooftops of their houses should be able to call for help. It should be noted while a raised platform would help to protect equipment from damage, a redundant power supply is also required. The full restoration for affected telco towers took longer than expected as several sites were down due to power supply issues. According to Tenaga Nasional Berhad, works to restore electricity supply are still in progress and there are still several locations without electricity in Johor, Negeri Sembilan, and Melaka as of 10pm this evening. Better emergency alert system needed Annuar Musa also wanted the relevant parties including the Information Department and Department of Broadcasting to come out with a more effective information delivery system in flood-prone areas including early warnings. He said the current conventional methods such as Info on Wheels, which is essentially vehicles with loud hailers, are quite limited. He said in Japan, every mobile user including tourists will receive a message alert when an earthquake is about to happen. After what Malaysia went through, he wants a better system where information can reach every user exposed to disasters wherever they are.

The “most notable” projects in BSC blockchain gaming still in its early days already has had a backing on more that $5million. Here’s what you need to know. Ertha was inspired by Heros of Might and Magic What is Ertha? A bit like Age of Empires meets Bitcoin in layman’s terms, Ertha’s world is a complex play space where players can create new governments, economies, and shaky alliances with other players set in real countries and geography. In a worryingly plausible scenario, the hyper-realistic gameplay is set in 2066 when global warming sees humanity of the brink of extinction but scientists have created a last hope – a metaverse where players are linked together to “utilise land in a more sustainable way” and give them a turn to make the decisions. Despite the marketing pictures showing a woman looking more like she belongs to Resident Evil, the game says players will have a go at “saving the world,” trading and feeding everyone sustainably after “our real world has fallen apart due to government and corporations making wrong and late decisions” – an obvious appeal after two years living in a pandemic and countless headlines about how many years we have left until Earth becomes inhabitable. There are 350 thousand plots of land, each of which collects taxes, fees, and other forms of revenue from the transactions taking place on them. ‘Erthaverse’ is divided into 350,000 HEX land plots, each of which represents a piece of land in the real world. The resources and features available on each plot are different from the next one. Players will assume the role of landowners who will carry out construction work on their plots of land.

Whether you want to fight your way to dominance or take a more subtle path, the game will cater to different play styles.

Businessman Businessman’s role is for those who want to lead manufacturing and supply other players with gear, food, and medical supplies. Businesses will be needed to gather resources, create materials, and manufacture goods. Choosing to scale horizontally or vertically and utilizing the country’s technological level may lead to a player becoming an industry shark known for market manipulation or having the cheapest products. Scholar Scholar character is for those looking to dominate the market. Since the output of factories is highly dependent on the skills of employees, players aspiring to become the world’s most educated people will need to study and improve their real-life knowledge.

A strong reputation ensures a steady stream of job offers and good pay. Some players will be tasked with protecting the populace. While the other combatants will undoubtedly annoy others – attacking players, factories, and warehouses. Nations Players will be able to develop their country in a way that reflects their goals and pace. Citizens’ activity inputs determine a country’s prosperity or poverty. The game is balanced so that every player’s actions matter. Scholars raise the technological level of various industries in the region, allowing business people to access more valuable products. Equipment, food and medical supplies enable other businessmen’s time to be spent more efficiently. The fighters ensure the state’s and citizens’ safety. Resources The game’s land is abundant with resources. Resources are classified as common or exclusive. Each country has all generic resources and only one out of three exclusive resources. To maximize production efficiency, every country should seek a well-balanced resource gathering. Companies Company is the main tool for creating resources and products in the game. Companies are divided into two categories: resource and product. Each firm has five upgrade levels. Every company level adds new employee work slots and raises their security status. Resources group company Certain resources require certain factories, placed in specific locations. To produce Wood, a player must build a Wood factory in a hexagon containing wood resources. How to earn money in Ertha? Players will be able to make use of the Play-to-Earn system, earning crypto tokens that can be traded and have real value. There will be many ways for players to earn these tokens, but the most notable way is becoming a landowner. Landowners are players who own land (HEXs) in the ERTHA metaverse. These land plots are already available for purchase in the private sale. Currently, there are 11 countries available but the developers hope 350,000 HEXs will be available in total. Being an owner of a HEX in the metaverse of ERTHA also means you’re entitled to earn revenue from everything financial that happens on your HEX. Let’s say you rent out a plot of land, for a business to be developed by another player. You’ll earn tokens by collecting rent and some revenue from his business transactions. Businesses will create jobs — skilled players will be able to work in various positions and earn their salaries. The Play-2-Learn aspect plays a strong role here — the more skilled a worker is, the more income they will be able to gain.

259,"The Quebec government wants to bring an NHL team to the capital, but fans skeptical",2022-01-02,"MONTREAL - Quebec politicians are meeting with National Hockey League brass in January, but it's unclear what influence the government can have on the...","MONTREAL — Quebec politicians are meeting with National Hockey League brass in January, but it’s unclear what influence the government can have on the league or whether team owners have any interest in bringing the Nordiques back to the provincial capital. Local fans, meanwhile, aren’t holding their breath, following a series of disappointments, and they say they aren’t so sure the government’s latest move is anything more than a public relations stunt. Premier François Legault opened the door to such musings in November, professing an interest in seeing professional hockey return to Quebec City and announcing a senior minister had been tabbed to support the effort. “I tell myself that if Ottawa and Winnipeg are able to have a team, we should be able to have a team in Quebec,” Legault told reporters at the time, adding that his government was looking for partners to help fund the estimated $1-billion cost of a franchise. The Nordiques left Quebec City after the 1994-95 NHL season, relocating to Denver to become the Colorado Avalanche, which won the Stanley Cup in the new team’s first season. Quebec City fans were optimistic about getting an NHL team back a decade ago but are much less so now, says Vince Cauchon, a Quebec City sports radio host who co-founded Nordiques Nation, a booster group that included 100,000 members at its peak. He says the recent news landed with a bit of a thud. “We were looking for the fire behind the smoke, and it’s a rare case of smoke without fire,” Cauchon said in a recent interview about Legault’s stated ambitions. “If it’s something that was politically motivated to rally the population, it had the effect of a sword cutting through water. The reaction was negligible — even bad.” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has confirmed a January meeting with “someone high up” from Quebec, but he said he knew nothing about what was on the agenda and tempered any expectations, noting that no teams were looking to relocate and that there were no expansion plans. A spokeswoman for Finance Minister Eric Girard, Quebec’s emissary for the meeting, declined to comment until later, but she said he’s been working on the file since the summer. About a decade ago, the possible return of NHL hockey had locals salivating at luring a struggling U.S. team back across the border. Fans decked out in Nordiques merchandise bused to different arenas in the United States and even gathered at the Plains of Abraham for a massive rally in October 2010. But Cauchon said expansion hopes soon fizzled. The league welcomed a new team in Las Vegas in 2016 but deferred the application for Quebec City. Quebec’s capital wasn’t considered when Seattle was awarded an expansion team in 2018. Talk of moving teams out of North Carolina and Arizona never materialized. “Heartbroken,” Cauchon said, describing the feeling among Quebec City NHL fans. “I think people will believe it when they see it, and I understand their sentiments.” Retired Nordiques winger Alain Côté said he’s pleased the Legault government is pushing for a new team, but he says he has doubts the league will allow it. “I find it a lot of fun that the premier is putting this forward,” said Côté, a popular winger who now owns auto parts stores in the capital. “We have a super nice arena here in Quebec City — a modern building, so it would be fun to use it for an NHL team,” he said of the Videotron Centre, which opened in 2015. Côté says he believes a lot has changed since the club left that plays in the city’s favour: an NHL salary cap, a new arena and a loyal fan base. But what Quebec City doesn’t have is the league’s interest. Côté says he thinks the NHL sees Quebec City as part of the Montreal market, served by the Canadiens. “There has to be a will, and I don’t see any from the league — absolutely none,” Côté said. Cauchon said it’s unclear what group would spearhead a bid for a new team and gain the support of the league’s 32 owners. The previous bid was fronted by Quebecor, the telecommunications company that received a 25-year contract to manage the Videotron Centre. Concordia University sports economist Moshe Lander said that deep-pocketed billionaires are in short supply in the province. Seattle and Las Vegas paid expansion fees of US$600 million and built billion-dollar arenas in their markets. The other question involves looking ahead to ensure long-term viability, he said. “That’s the type of thing that will concern the NHL: if you want a toy to play with, you want to make sure what keeps a franchise going up is the next person in line is going to pay more than the previous person,” Lander said. “It’s not just a current problem, it’s an ongoing problem … the question of whose next.” François Emond, who operates a family furniture business in Alma, Que., says he wholeheartedly supports the Legault government’s efforts. “The government is doing the right thing by getting involved in the file — not financially — but certainly showing some leadership,” Emond said. He said he remembers boarding the bus from the Saguenay region to watch the Nordiques play. Busses headed to the old Colisée arena in Quebec City used to be a common sight in many parts of eastern Quebec. “I can understand people’s disappointment,” Emond said. “That we’re even talking about it, I think it’s a positive thing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 2, 2022.

He goes highbrow with Chekov but isn't above graphic hyperbole.,"It’s hard to believe Dexter fans are already about to deal with another conclusion. The Dexter: New Blood ending is coming fast, but will hopefully prove more satisfying than the original ending of the series. Showrunner Clyde Phillips has already predicted it. L-R: Jack Alcott and Michael C. Hall | Seacia Pavao/Showtime Phillips was a guest on The Hollywood Reporter’s TV’s Top Five podcast on Nov. 5 just before Dexter: New Blood premiered. He teased the ending and promised a major reaction. The Deter: New Blood ending airs Jan. 9 at 9 p.m. on Showtime. The ‘Dexter: New Blood’ ending will be like Chekhov Anton Chekhov is famous for a lot of dramatic theories. Chekhov’s gun means any gun introduced early in a story will be fired at some point, Phillips had another Chekhov theory that applies to the Dexter: New Blood ending.  “I’m going to quote Chekov,” Phillips told TV’s Top Five. “Chekhov said the ending should be surprising yet inevitable. Ours is surprising, inevitable and satisfying. The audience will be satisfied with the end while their own brains are exploding.” ‘Dexter: New Blood’ has a lot to resolve  Phillips also discussed the story the Dexter: New Blood ending will have to resolve. Harrison (Jack Alcott) found his father in the first episode. By the end of the season, Dexter fans have seen whether Harrison takes after his father or not. Phillips promises definitive answers. RELATED: ‘Dexter: New Blood’ Exes Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter ‘Have a Great Time on Set’, Says Showrunner “That’s the big question of the year, of the season that we’re doing,” Phillips said. “Does Harrison have the dark passenger or not? Does he have that inherited trauma, does he remember? That’s what we’re exploring.” Although Dexter: New Blood unfolded over 10 episodes airing weekly, Phillips reminded viewers that they take place in a much more confined period of time. Keep that in mind when you watch the Dexter: New Blood ending. “The whole show takes place in a two week time period,” Phillips said. “It’s basically Christmas, New Years of this year.” It has been eight years since Dexter was on the air, and Phillips left after season 4. He also promised the Dexter: New Blood ending has adapted to the 2021 television landscape.

The storytelling has changed I think in concert with the audience changing and being more demanding, having so many choices. We want to break through the clutter and break through the noise and be honest and tell a great f***ing show. And I believe we got there.” The ‘Dexter: New Blood’ ending may not be the end  Showtime billed Dexter: New Blood as a limited series. Phillips calls it a revival series, and he does not rule out continuing it. “Let me say this to answer that,” Phillips said. “Never say never. I could’ve said yes or no. I’m saying never say never. Anything can happen and I’m not going to commit to the fact that this is the absolute end of the franchise. I think that’s a pretty revealing answer.” RELATED: ‘Dexter: New Blood’ Writers Are Having 1 Major Problem Writing for Deb Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet",['Dexter'],https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/dexter-new-blood-ending-surprising-yet-inevitable-make-viewers-brains-explode-clyde-phillips-promises.html/,,cheatsheet

The post Apex Legends’ Sentinel sniper is bugged and it’s making players “go crazy” appeared first on Dexerto.","Apex Legends fans have noticed the bolt-action Sentinel sniper rifle’s recharge timer is broken, and it’s making players go crazy. There’s a lot of content in Apex Legends, and sometimes the devs can overlook certain aspects of the game – which leads to bugs, exploits, and a lot of balancing changes needed. While it’s not completely game-breaking, Apex Legends players have noticed that the popular and unique bolt-action Sentinel sniper rifle’s recharge timer is broken – and it’s seriously confusing. The Sentinel sniper rifle was introduced to Apex Legends in Season 4. A Reddit thread from Apex Legends player dj_b2 on January 2 first pointed out that the Sentinel charge timer is broken, and pleaded to the devs to fix it. Read More: Simple Apex Legends counter makes Fuse’s Ultimate far less deadly The unique rifle has a recharge time of five seconds, which has a countdown in the bottom right corner when recharging. However, as demonstrated in dj_b2’s video, it takes more time after it reaches zero to charge properly. “Can they fix the Sentinel charge soon,” dj_b2 asked. “Why even have a timer if it takes more time after it reaches 0 and the bar has been filled?” Other Apex Legends fans seemed to have noticed it themselves as well and were relieved to find out they weren’t going crazy. “I really thought I was just an idiot. Glad I’m not going crazy here,” said one player. It seems the Sentinel rifle isn’t the only weapon to have the issue, as the Rampage LMG supposedly has the same problem. “Same thing happening with the rampage, that sh*t is annoying as hell,” claimed one player. However, the Rampage timer issues aren’t as noticeable as the Sentinel according to mikah42106: “Rampage is much less noticeable thankfully, but still bothersome.” With multiple complaints from players, it’s likely that the Respawn devs will investigate and look to fix the timer issues.

The Belgium international spoke to Sky Italia three weeks ago, though the interview was only released on Thursday, and revealed he ‘was not very happy’ at Chelsea and accused manager Thomas Tuchel of ‘playing a different formation’ that does not get the best out of him. Lukaku also made it clear he was hoping to return to former club Inter Milan while he is still in the prime of his career, with his comments causing confusion and anger at Chelsea. Lukaku’s future at Chelsea is suddenly up in the air (Picture: Getty) Tuchel reacted by axing the striker from the matchday squad for Sunday’s Premier League clash with title rivals Liverpool and says he needed to speak to the forward to understand what prompted his comments. Now the 28-year-old’s former Everton teammate Tim Howard, who works as a pundit for NBC Sports, has revealed that Lukaku is belatedly keeping quiet following his explosive interview and has a meeting with Chelsea scheduled for Monday. NBC Sports presenter Rebecca Lowe passed on the ex-USA goalkeeper’s information, saying on Sunday: ‘Tim Howard has been texting with Romelu Lukaku. ‘Lukaku says he can’t talk too much about it, it’s very hot, but there’s another meeting – Lukaku told Tim – on Monday. He says he has another meeting on Monday and he can talk more after that.’ More: Chelsea FCMauricio Pochettino tells PSG to sign Chelsea star in £30m transfer dealThomas Tuchel considers two punishments for outspoken Chelsea striker Romelu LukakuChelsea enter race to sign former Tottenham star and Man Utd transfer target Although Lukaku never had any intention of trying to leave Chelsea when he gave his interview, ESPN report that he could have a change of heart if Tuchel continues to leave him out of the squad and if he is hit with a big fine. Tuchel said he was confused and bewildered by Lukaku’s interview, feeling that his words were in stark contrast to his behaviour, while he was also perplexed by his remarks about playing with a different formation. Discussing the situation regarding Lukaku, Tuchel told Sky Sports: ‘I will not try to tell you that we are happy about it. Does a dressing room always need to be a sensitive dressing room? Does it always need to be full of harmony? No. It’s sometimes even good if it’s not always in full harmony. ðŸš¨Romelu Lukaku to @TimHowardGK:â€œI canâ€™t say too much. The situation is hot.

Because it is very hard to understand because how he behaves, how he plays, how he scores, even now right after injury, how he behaves on a daily basis, how we have talks with myself… it’s very surprising.’ Asked specifically about the formation comment, Tuchel added: ‘I don’t know actually!

274,An Ohio high school athlete is suing his coaches for allegedly forcing him to eat pizza with pepperoni grease as a punishment for missing an off-season workout,2022-01-02,"The student is seeking $10 million in damages, claiming the act was a violation of his Jewish beliefs.","Pepperoni pizza.Karl Tapales/Getty Images An Ohio high school student is suing his coaches for allegedly forcing him to eat pizza with pepperoni. The student, who is Jewish, said consuming pork products goes against his religious beliefs. The coaches allegedly forced him to consume an entire pizza with pepperoni residue as a punishment for missing a workout. An Ohio high school student is suing his former football coaches for allegedly forcing him to eat pizza with pepperoni on it, according to a lawsuit filed in the Ohio Northern District Court. The lawsuit, filed last week against the Canton City School District, the city's board of education, and the coaches, alleges that the student protested against eating the pizza because consumption of pork-based product and residue goes against his religious beliefs. According to the lawsuit, the student converted to Judaism when he was 10. The student filing the lawsuit is unnamed, referred to only as ""Junior"" and described as a high school senior expected to graduate in June 2022. The coaches in May required a mandatory off-season workout for all players to attend. But Junior missed the workout ""as a result of a slight shoulder injury sustained while lifting weights,"" the lawsuit says. At the next mandatory off-season workout, Junior showed up and was approached by his coaches, who told him he'd ""be disciplined for missing the weight program,"" according to the complaint. The coaches sat him down in a ""lone chair that was placed in the middle of the gymnasium floor,"" the lawsuit says. They then ""gave Junior a large pork pepperoni pizza and ordered Junior to eat the entire pizza as punishment for failing to appear on May 20th, 2021. Junior objected and reminded [the coaches] that he does not eat pork, due to his religious beliefs.""He also kicked the pizza box away from him, which the complaint says was captured on video camera.The coaches went after the pizza box and brought it back, again insisting that he eat it. Junior refused to do so a ""minimum of ten times,"" and the coaches then said he could take off the pepperoni. But even without the pepperoni, the pork residue still coated the pizza, the lawsuit says. Then the coaches gave him an ultimatum: eat the pizza or potentially be booted off the football team, according to the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the other players were running around the gym, unable to stop until Junior finished the pizza. ""Junior, against his religious beliefs, was forced to eat the pork grease pizza. Immediately after, Junior was punished further by [the coaches] and was forced to run up and down the football field,"" the lawsuit says. Forcing football players to eat food as punishment is a routine occurrence, the lawsuit claims. The coaches themselves said ""they had previously and routinely punished their football players by requiring them to eat miscellaneous products for breaking rules and regulations of the football team,"" according to the complaint.Prior to the alleged incident, Junior made it known during team luncheons and dinners that he would be unable to eat pork at the events and required alternative food options, the lawsuit says. He also says he filled out several forms listing his dietary restrictions. The coaches were fired in June, according to the lawsuit. The student seeks $10 million in damages, claiming that he ""became the subject of threats and ridicule from his teammates and the general public"" and ""was forced to enroll in a different school and football program"" due to safety concerns. The Canton City School District did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.Read the original article on Insider","['News', 'Ohio', 'Religious freedom', 'Jewish']",https://www.insider.com/ohio-student-athlete-sues-coaches-pizza-2022-1,,insider

Masami looks forward to a lot of things at New Year, like receiving nengajo, watching the annual kohaku song battle on TV, and eating osechi New Year’s dishes. One of the things she most looks forward to, though, is purchasing one of the country’s most sought-after fukubukuro lucky bags, which comes from Donguri Kyowakoku, the retail chain renowned for selling official Studio Ghibli goods. Like all lucky bags, this one contains a selection of items worth more than the price you pay for it, and one of its main draws is the fact that the contents inside are never revealed beforehand. So, like a box of Ghibli chocolates, you don’t know which ones you’re gonna get. ▼ The items differ from bag to bag too, so what’s inside really is up to the fukubukuro gods. Masami reserved her fukubukuro at her nearest branch of the chain as soon as reservations opened at the beginning of December, and she returned on 2 January to pick up her bag of goods, which are only being made in limited numbers. So what did she get? Let’s take a look at her haul below! ▼ The “Otanoshimi Bukuro” (“Enjoyment Bag”) cost Masami 4,000 yen (US$34.75) The bag contained the following products: ・My Neighbour Totoro Pocket Tote ・My Neighbour Totoro Eyelet Curtain ・Whisper of the Heart Pocketable Eco Bag ・Whisper of the Heart Fernanda Fragrance Body Mist Pear Bouquet (Facial toner) ・Kiki’s Delivery Service Jiji Magnet ・Kiki’s Delivery Service Petit Jiji Handkerchief ・Kiki’s Delivery Service Stainless Steel Portable Thermos ・Mary and the Witch’s Flower Handkerchief ▼ The My Neighbour Totoro Pocket Tote was beautifully adorned in Soot Sprites and Totoros, interspersed with woodsy images. The bag was well made, using thick, sturdy fabric, and it came with a nice, smooth lining and handy pockets as well. ▼ Masami particularly liked the snug corner for drink bottles. One of the most surprising items in the haul was the My Neighbour Totoro Eyelet Curtain, which ended up being the perfect length to cover the passage between hall and bathroom at Masami’s place. The Whisper of the Heart Pocketable Eco Bag was another nice surprise, seeing as Masami has been using eco bags since free plastic bags were abolished at stores in Japan in July 2020. ▼ A “Hopeful Story” for anime fans, and the environment. The Whisper of the Heart Fernanda Fragrance Body Mist promised to deliver good anime vibes to Masami’s daily beauty routine… …while the Mary and the Witch’s Flower Handkerchief promised to add some anime magic to her wardrobe. Masami is a big fan of Kiki’s Delivery Service, so she was overjoyed to receive this adorable magnet of Jiji peering at her over his shoulder. ▼ The magical black cat also peered out at Masami from this adorable little handkerchief. ▼ One of the biggest surprises in the bundle was the beautiful Kiki’s Delivery Service Stainless Steel Portable Thermos. In Japan, Thermos flasks are called “mahoubin” (literally “Magic Bottle“), making this a particularly apt item for Kiki’s Delivery Service, which is known here as “Mahou no Takkyubin“, or “Magic Delivery Service“. Masami was happy with absolutely everything she received, not just because of the sheer cuteness of it all, but the fact that she’ll be able to use all the products on a daily basis. And speaking from experience, after picking up the Ghibli lucky bags in 2020, 2019, and 2018, adding a touch of Ghibli magic to your day 365 days a year is Masami’s idea of a very good year!

While including several rules in 2022, the budget caps are also a significant rule that will alter the competition. Ferrari, which usually spends tons of money every season, has been vocal against this specific rule. Moreover, many teams have also spoken against repairing costs being added to the budget caps. However, the leadership at FIA and F1 are currently not entertaining the opposition of the big fishes, so Ferrari will have to deal with it. Seeing that even repairing costs will have to be adjusted in the budget caps, Ferrari boss Laurent Mekies hopes for fewer crashes in 2022 to save teams from worrying about money. “There is less money available for development during the season, because the overall budget has also shrunk,” Mekies explained. “We will see more upgrades than in the 2021 season, but also fewer than in 2018 or 2019.” “We encouraged our drivers to sound out the limits,” he said of 2021. “Because the competition between the two of them helps us advance. This year [2021], there was relatively little development on the car.” “We were able to live better with accidents in terms of budget. That will be different in 2022 – we need all the money for vehicle development.” Also read: Lando Norris reveals how McLaren lost to Ferrari in the constructors’ championship Ferrari boss thinks 2022 cars will be tougher to drive In 2022, the new regulations will reshape cars.

In the beginning, the loss of lap time was huge.” “We made up a lot of it, but nobody knows if that is enough. You put the car on the road in Barcelona [testing] and hope that it does what the simulations and the wind tunnel promise.” “After six weeks, it [the gap] will be less and, by 2023, the cars will be pretty much the same. The window of what is feasible is simply much smaller than it is today,” Ferrari boss said. “The cars will certainly be more difficult to drive. It will depend a lot on the driver how they adapt to them. We are well equipped with Charles and Carlos.

279,"2022 is the year I buy an LG OLED TV, promise",2022-01-02,"OLED TVs offer the best performance for a mid-range price, and it’s time I finally commit to a singular purchase.","<article> <p>One of the great privileges of being a technology journalist is the gadgets. Not free gadgets, mind you – no one seems to like me enough to bribe me outright – but lent gadgets. The <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/best-tv"">smart TVs</a>, speakers, <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/best-vacuum-cleaners"">vacuums</a>, <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-vr-headset"">VR headsets</a> that are thrust into our hands for just enough time to like them, hate them, and review them before they’re cruelly taken away.</p><p>It makes the question of purchasing our own devices a tricky one, though. As the previous Home Cinema Editor for TechRadar, I had new, and often excellent, TV screens coming through my flat every couple of weeks. </p><p>If I timed my binges right, I could save up a good few episodes of Succession or a Blade Runner 2049 movie night for just when a review unit arrived, and make do with more casual viewing on a laptop screen in between test TVs. So investing in my own, permanent screen didn’t always feel like a tempting proposition when the kinds of displays I got to test were often worth double my monthly salary. Why buy something that can’t live up to the flashier models passing through so regularly?</p><p>It’s in that context I got to try out the <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-c1-oled-tv-oled65c1"">LG C1 OLED</a>, which is one of the <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/best-tv"">best TVs of 2021</a>. I’ve always had a penchant for LG screens when it comes to <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-oled"">OLED</a>, preferring LG’s slight pop of color over the more muted – if color-accurate – tones of Panasonic or Sony. All those years of bright cartoons have lodged somewhere in my brain, demanding vivid pictures at all costs.</p><p>It helps, too, that there’s a 48-inch version of the LG C1 OLED. I have one very specific place in my living room that can house a TV, at a maximum 48-inch/49-inch size, so going larger than that is not an option. Having had a <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/best/48-inch-oled-tv"">48-inch OLED</a> on my shelf for a few weeks, I’m now convinced I need to commit to the enterprise.</p> <h2 id=""shelf-life-5"">Shelf life</h2> <p>I really can’t stress enough how much I love the 48-inch sizing option, allowing people to fit an <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/best-oled-tvs-our-pick-of-the-best-oled-televisions-you-can-buy-today"">OLED TV</a> in their home much more easily. Countless shelves or countertops too small for a 55-incher can comfortably house its smaller sibling and, in the tight spaces of urban homes especially, that kind of additional flexibility can’t be overlooked. </p><p>The 48-inch OLED is a brilliant middle-ground, neither a <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/television/tv/10-best-32-inch-tvs-in-the-world-today-655660"">small TV</a> you have to squint at nor a great hulking beast that’s permanently jutting into your eye line. Most people don’t have dedicated <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/nz/best/best-home-theater-system-the-kit-you-need-for-that-perfect-home-cinema"">home cinema</a> rooms and it’s very possible for a large screen to dominate your living space. </p><p>There’s been huge interest over the years in <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/should-i-buy-samsung-the-frame-tv"">Samsung’s The Frame</a>, a designer-first TV that can blend into the background disguised as a picture frame. And many people opt for <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/best/4k-projector"">projectors</a> for the same reason, in order to reduce the size and bulk of machinery around them on an everyday basis.</p><p>It’s why I’m hoping talk of <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/news/new-42-inch-oled-tvs-are-on-the-way-but-which-tv-brands-will-get-them"">42-inch OLED TVs</a> come sooner rather than later, as the general movement of the market towards ever-larger screens risks leaving space-constrained buyers without the chance to experience premium TV technology.</p> <h2 id=""saving-up-that-allowance-5"">Saving up that allowance</h2> <p>For me, there’s a firm psychological barrier to hitting the $1,000 / £1,000 (around AU$1,400) mark, where that fourth figure just pushes past the realm of rational spending. It’s why <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-sales"">Black Friday</a> often has so many tempting <a href=""https://www.techradar.com/deals/cheap-4k-tv-deals-sales"">TV deals</a>, slashing the list price to something just within your budget and pushing you to act immediately. And while the 48-inch LG C1 is usually $1,099 / £1,099 / AU$2,500, just over that limit, UK sales have seen that drop to £999, or even £899 for brief periods.</p><p>Having missed my chance in this year’s sales – eternally blithering over the price I actually wanted to cap my spending at – I’ll be keeping a keen eye on the price of OLED TVs in the new year, as 2021 models gradually get cheaper ahead of their 2022 successors launching.</p><p>If the LG C1 drops to £999 again, I should really go for it, though I'm tempted to hold out for a bigger price drop.

Sources say he may be stripped of his royal title and exiled from public life, The Sunday Times reports. Virginia Giuffre alleges that Prince Andrew abused her as part of Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking ring. Buckingham Palace is in discussions about what to do about Prince Andrew's relationship with the monarchy. Sources say he may be exiled from public life, The Sunday Times reports. Royal courtiers may consider asking Prince Andrew not to use his title, the Duke of York if, he loses a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, The Sunday Times report. Sources close to the discussions told the newspaper that the plans are being discussed to ask Prince Andrew to disappear from public life and would be sent into a form of ""internal exile,"" should he lose the case. Giuffre, 38, a victim of disgraced financier Jeffery Epstein's trafficking ring, alleged that she was sexually abused by the Queen's son three times when she was 17 and sought damages in a US court.Prince Andrew, 61, and the Royal Family have repeatedly denied Giuffre's allegations. However, it is thought that the recent conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell — who introduced Prince Andrew and Epstein — may make Prince Andrew's case harder to fight due to the established connections between the pair. The Sunday Times reports that no official plans have yet been made. However, royal officials have noted that steps would have to be taken to protect and preserve the monarchy.Speaking to The Sunday Times, the source said: ""Andrew is still patron of a heck of a lot of charities and they would have to go as well. He couldn't go abroad because of the risk of extradition so there would have to be a form of internal exile. He would need to scale back on his housing.""The source also stated Prince Andrew has ""disgraced"" his title as the Duke of York. A Buckingham Palace spokesman told the newspaper, ""This is speculation and the comments are without foundation. We would not comment on an ongoing legal matter.""Prince Andrew and his legal team attempted to block Giuffre's lawsuit against him because she no longer lives in the US. However, this attempt was dismissed by a US judge, AP news report. Prince Andrew's legal team did not respond to a request for comment from The Sunday Times.This week a 2009 settlement agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, which could have bearing on Giuffre's civil lawsuit accusing Prince Andrew of sexual abuse, will be made public, according to Reuters.Read the original article on Insider","['News', 'Royals', 'prince andrew', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'Ghislaine Maxwell', 'Virginia Giuffre', 'UK Weekend']",https://www.insider.com/prince-andrew-faces-internal-exile-if-he-loses-epstein-lawsuit-sunday-times-2022-1,,insider

The Sunday Mirror (02/01, p64) claim that West Ham are looking towards Embolo to bolster David Moyes’ attacking options. Embolo impressed for Switzerland at Euro 2020 and could now earn himself a move to the Premier League. “Maeda will set the tone for Ange at Celtic” | Japanese football expert Sam RobsonBridTV7543“Maeda will set the tone for Ange at Celtic” | Japanese football expert Sam Robson934497934497centerUCqUPn73T2WxGyzCdtLe8m7g67 Hail Hail (Youtube)https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwng3RIc-bAXurA5yt1Vj63uuVOBD1RQ9n6j_XKhD=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj13872 Gladbach have struggled n the Bundesliga this season and may be willing to sell in order to fund new recruits of their own. Back in July, 90Min reported that West Ham had lodged an enquiry in the the hope of signing Embolo. Former Hammers ace Don Hutchison even claimed during Euro 2020 that Embolo was a ‘younger Michail Antonio’. That sounds ideal for West Ham. David Moyes needs another striker to help Antonio, but the problem with former striker Sebastien Haller was that he was too different to Antonio. Photo by Christian Verheyen/Borussia Moenchengladbach via Getty Images Haller was more of a static target man rather than an all-action attacker like Antonio, meaning West Ham didn’t have the same fluency. Embolo does have very similar characteristics to Antonio, and that may be why West Ham are so keen. The 24-year-old has noticed four goals and four assists in all competitions and still has plenty of untapped potential. Fending off Brighton won’t be easy, but you can see why West Ham are keen to snap up Embolo this month.

283,Ricciardo labelled ‘disappointment’ of 2021 season,2022-01-02,"Stoffel Vandoorne thinks it was great to see Daniel Ricciardo win a race, but he was a 'small disappointment' overall in 2021. The post Ricciardo labelled ‘disappointment’ of 2021 season appeared first on PlanetF1.","Stoffel Vandoorne said it was a “great feeling” seeing Esteban Ocon and Daniel Ricciardo win races, but said the Australian was a “small disappointment” of the season as a whole. Ricciardo has been open about his struggles in his first year at McLaren – in the first half of the season in particular – but still has full belief in himself that he’s the best on the grid. While he recovered some of the points deficit to Lando Norris in the second half of the year, he was still beaten by his young team-mate in the Drivers’ Championship, which Vandoorne feels made for a “difficult season” for the eight-time race winner. “If I have to point to one small disappointment about the season, I would almost say Daniel Ricciardo,” the Belgian told RTBF. “It’s true that he won at Monza, but in general he was a little bit behind Lando Norris, whereas he is usually the leader in the teams he drives for. “If you take away his win in Italy, 2021 is a bit of a difficult season for Daniel.” Ricciardo took his first win since 2018 when he took the chequered flag at Monza, while Esteban Ocon became a first-time winner in Formula 1 when he controlled a frantic race in Hungary. Vandoorne said it’s enjoyable to see unlikely winners in a race dominated by two title challenges, and feels they’re stand-out memorable moments alongside a fascinating title battle. “It’s always a great feeling, especially in races where things weren’t going well for Max and Lewis,” said the former McLaren driver. “I think everyone enjoyed seeing Ocon’s first win and then Daniel’s success after a difficult period for him. Those are the events that everyone remembers in a season.” On the other side of the coin, Vandoorne also paid tribute to Norris and Carlos Sainz for their performances over the course of the season, beating more fancied drivers in Ricciardo and Charles Leclerc to win the intra-team battles at McLaren and Ferrari respectively.   “This year Norris did a very good job,” said Vandoorne. “He was sometimes unlucky at the end of the season when he lost a lot of points in the last races. But without that, he should have finished fifth in the championship. “Carlos also had a great season with Ferrari in his first year with the Scuderia, especially against Leclerc. It wasn’t easy to arrive in a team that revolved around the Monegasque.”     The post Ricciardo labelled ‘disappointment’ of 2021 season appeared first on PlanetF1.","['News', 'Daniel Ricciardo', 'Esteban Ocon']",https://www.planetf1.com/news/stoffel-vandoorne-daniel-ricciardo-disappointment/,,planetf1

Critics said ""Bad Boys"" didn't offer too much in terms of a compelling story, but for some, it skated by on Smith and Lawrence's charm. ""The plot and characterisation are largely irrelevant — just sit back and feast on the adrenaline-pumping action and the live-wire banter of the two stars,"" John Ferguson reviewed for Radio Times.

""Overall, 'Aladdin' wasn't perfect, but nothing will ever live up to the classic '92 version,"" Aramide Tinubu wrote for Stylecaster.

Many critics felt like ""Concussion"" could've been a truly gripping drama if it had benefited from better direction.

Despite being called formulaic and chock-full of cheesy dialogue, ""Independence Day"" still endures with reviewers as a solid blockbuster. ""'Independence Day,' then and now, remains the epitome of a stand-up-and-cheer movie,"" Don Shanahan wrote for 25 Years Later.

Although imperfect, ""Men in Black III"" was still appreciated by many critics, who thought it shook off the shortcomings of the second installment. ""While it's a little thrown together, 'Men in Black 3' definitely has one thing going for it: The filmmakers seem focused on recapturing not just the style but also the soul of the original,"" Tim Grierson reviewed for Deadspin. In ""Hitch"" (2005), Smith starred as Alex Hitchens.Will Smith and Eva Mendes in ""Hitch.""Columbia PicturesRotten Tomatoes score: 69%Summary: After years of striking out with the ladies, Albert (Kevin James) seeks help from love guru Alex ""Hitch"" Hitchens (Smith). But when Hitch meets Sara (Eva Mendes), he realizes he may need to rethink his own approach to love.

""'Men in Black' is the wryest, sharpest, most entertaining special effects film in recent memory, a simultaneous participant and mocking parody of the more-bang-for-your-buck behemoth genre,"" Paul Tatara wrote for CNN.

285,Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel compares Manchester City’s EPL dominance to Bayern Munich,2022-01-02,,"Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images Ahead of the Blues’ clash against Liverpool, Tuchel discussed how tough it is to keep pace with Man City. With the English Premier League emerging from a slew of winter fixtures, the title race is looking a lot less competitive than it did a few weeks ago. Manchester City have opened up a staggering 11 point gap on 2nd placed Chelsea, with Liverpool, Arsenal, and the rest all bringing up the pack. Even if some teams have a few games on hand, it’s looking likely that City will storm their way to another title. Speaking to the media ahead of the Blues upcoming clash against Liverpool, Tuchel compared the task of keeping up with City to his efforts in the Bundesliga, where his record-breaking Borussia Dortmund side still fell short to Bayern Munich in the end. Pep Guardiola was the man in charge of the Bavarians even then, and it looks like he’s managed to bring that brand of dominance with him to England. “It [City] is a winning machine. It is not only about having an advantage, it is making it an advantage,” said Tuchel (via Manchester Evening News). “They are good. Very good. They are relentless. We have to admit where we come from one year ago. When you look at [the table for] 2021, we are 20 points behind. You have to be careful that you are ambitious but not over-ambitious and do not to get frustrated by not catching Man City in the first half year.” Photo credit should read TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images Back in Dortmund, Tuchel had to contend with an all-conquering Guardiola coached Munich side. Tuchel’s words sort-of echo the current state of the Bundesliga, where Borussia Dortmund suddenly found themselves out of the title race in just a couple of weeks. “Two or three weeks ago, we had a super close title race. Now we have lost the edge a little bit, I think because of circumstances that we cannot influence and that gave them a certain advantage and a certain leap. They have five or six years now of consistency. That makes it hard. It doesn’t make it impossible.” However, it doesn’t look like the former BVB boss is ready to throw in the towel, unlike his former employer. “As long as I’m here in my Borussia, Chelsea, I will do nothing else than make other teams underperform. We will even try to make Manchester City underperform. We will not stop.” “And Jurgen [Klopp], I’m pretty sure he will do the same to get the best out of Liverpool. And we, here, out of Chelsea. We will not stop chasing, we will not stop believing or stop doing this. Maybe the difference to the situation right now in the Bundesliga is we have the belief.” Maybe the folks over in Dortmund could do with some of that same belief. Bayern Munich only have a 9 point gap over the rest of the league, which is not impossible to close. Bayern themselves did it under Niko Kovac in 2019. Sure, it’s a tough ask, but with half the fixtures still remaining, anything could happen.",,https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2022/1/2/22863434/bayern-munich-chelsea-coach-thomas-tuchel-compares-manchester-city-dominance-pep-guariolda-liverpool,,bavarianfootballworks
286,Why 2022 could be the Yankees’ year,2022-01-02,,"Photo by Cole Burston/Getty Images Four reasons to be optimistic about the 2022 season It has been a quiet offseason for the New York Yankees. In advance of the current work stoppage, the club stood pat amid an absolute frenzy of free agent signings. Now, with the lockout in place and no meaningful negotiations, let alone progress toward ending it, on the immediate horizon, the club will not even have the chance to make any significant moves for a while. And though the 2021 club, like the 2020 team that preceded it, was wildly inconsistent and irritating, there are reasons to believe that the 2022 Yankees are set up for success with the pieces already in place. 1. Healthy Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton are monsters For the first time since the club obtained Stanton from Miami prior to the 2018 season, the Yankees’ hulking mashers stayed healthy for an entire season. In doing so, the two terrorized opposing pitching. Judge and Stanton combined to club 74 homeruns, racked up 9.1 bWAR together, and finished with a 149 and 136 OPS+, respectively. A quick look at the pair’s metrics provide reason to believe that if they stay healthy again in 2022, they will match or even exceed their 2021 production. Judge and Stanton are absolutely elite when it comes to smashing baseballs. Judge finished 2021 no lower than the 96th percentile in average exit velocity, maximum exit velocity, hard hit percentage, xwOBA, xBA, xSLG, and barrel percentage. While Stanton did not quite match Judge in all those categories, Giancarlo still finished 2021 in the 100th percentile in maximum exit velocity and hard hit percentage, and the 99th percentile in average exit velocity. Two of baseball’s biggest and strongest sluggers form the backbone of an offense that either one of them can put on their back when they go on a hot streak. If and when they are hot at the same time? That spells good things for the 2022 Yankees. 2. Signs of life from Gleyber Torres There is no real way to sugarcoat what a disaster the 2020 and 2021 seasons were for Gleyber Torres. After hitting 62 homeruns and turning in 121 and 125 wRC+ seasons prior to turning 23 years old, Torres fell off a cliff offensively, beginning in the COVID-abbreviated 2020 campaign. That continued last season, when Torres only managed to hit 9 homeruns in 127 games played and finished the season with a sub-par 94 wRC+. All that said, Torres was considerably better in the second half of 2021. His previous power surge did not reappear, but he did manage a .794 OPS, a mark almost 100 points higher than he finished the season with and finished the second half with a 115 wRC+. The Yankees finally pulled the plug on the Gleyber-as-a-shortstop experience in mid-September, and though correlation does not mean causality, Torres hit even better after the move. As a second baseman, he finished the season with a .300 batting average and a 124 wRC+, albeit in limited plate appearances. It seems highly unlikely that the club would play Gleyber at shortstop in 2022, so perhaps a full campaign back at second base will herald a return to the lofty offensive numbers that Torres achieved in his first two seasons rather than the dismal statistics he compiled the past two years. Any kind of return to form for Torres, who also stole more bases last season than any other returning Yankee, would almost certainly make the Yankees offense more formidable. 3. Luis Severino After missing almost all of the past three seasons, the former ace returned to the majors late in 2021. His gaudy results (a 0.00 ERA, for example) are basically meaningless, considering the small sample size of 6 innings pitched for the flame-throwing righthander. The important part is that Severino made it back to the big leagues after what seemed like innumerable setbacks and stayed healthy down the stretch, setting him up to contribute in 2022. The Yankees no longer need him to be the club’s ace. A fellow by the name of Gerrit Cole has that job on lockdown. But Corey Kluber is gone and Jameson Taillon is unlikely to be back in the rotation until May. Jordan Montgomery and Nestor Cortés Jr. will slot in behind Cole but even at the best of times, you can never have enough starting pitching. Considering we will probably still be dealing with COVID during the 2022 season, it is fair to say these are not the best of times. Starting pitching will continue to be at a premium. If Sevy can give the club 100 or so innings in 2022, the results are likely to be better than some of the hurlers the Yankees featured in 2021 (Andrew Heaney, anyone?). In an American League East division that figures to be tight and competitive again, Severino’s presence could make a legitimate difference. 4. Starting pitching Speaking of pitching... even without Kluber, who for anyone that missed it now toils for the hated Tampa Bay Rays, the Yankees return the five starting pitchers who threw the most innings for the club in 2021. Cole, Montgomery, Taillon (eventually), Cortés, and Domingo Germán will all don the pinstripes again this season. Of those five, only Germán pitched at a level below league average last year, finishing with a 94 ERA+. Overall, the Yankees pitching staff combined for 22.3 total fWAR, a total that ranked fourth in all of baseball. Barring massive regression from any of those pieces already in place, the rotation seems poised to be a strength for the club again in 2022. And there are other valuable contributors poised to make a difference. Severino’s aforementioned return looms. And Michael King, Luis Gil, and Clarke Schmidt, who seems ready to go for 2022, are just a few of the arms the Yankees can have toe the slab when required. The Yankees’ successes from 2017 through 2019 made it seem almost inevitable that the club would soon win a World Series. The past two seasons have poured cold water on that optimism. But there are reasons to think, even based on an underwhelming 2021 campaign, that the Yankees could be a formidable force in the American League when baseball returns. Stay tuned for next week when I argue with myself and list the four reasons I am pessimistic about 2022.",,https://www.pinstripealley.com/2022/1/2/22862674/yankees-analysis-aaron-judge-giancarlo-stanton-gleyber-torres-starting-pitching-luis-severino,,pinstripealley

EA DICE have a lot on their shoulders when it comes to winning players over with Battlefield 2042. With new content promised in the early stages of 2022, players are fleeing back to older games in the meantime. If you’re after a hilarious alternative to the critically mixed shooter, then developers Riverside Sports have got you covered.

Clownfield 2042’s premise is excellent Battlefield 2042 set out to provide an edgy near-future experience for players, but Clownfield 2042’s premise is far more compelling: “After 2022 cryptocrash caused by NFT’s, majority of nations collapsed and a union of “No-Clowns” has been formed.

290,Cavani receives unequivocal transfer response from Rangnick – ‘He knows that’,2022-01-02,The striker is facing an uncertain future at Man Utd after a decrease in his gametime in relation to last season The post Cavani receives unequivocal transfer response from Rangnick – ‘He knows that’ appeared first on TEAMtalk.,"Edinson Cavani will “definitely” be blocked from leaving Manchester United in January by Ralf Rangnick, the interim manager has confirmed. Cavani is facing an uncertain future at Man Utd after a decrease in his gametime in relation to last season. The striker has only started three Premier League matches this term. Last year, he played 13 times from the start in the competition. The return of Cristiano Ronaldo has no doubt had an affect on the space Cavani has in the team. They are capable of playing together, as they did recently against Burnley. However, in general, Rangnick will tend to pick one or the other. Therefore, Cavani has been considering his future. He has been heavily linked with a January transfer to Barcelona. The La Liga outfit need a new striker after Sergio Aguero retired due to a heart issue. Rumours in recent days have indicated that the track to take Cavani to Barcelona may be cooling. Even so, questions will continue to be asked of the 34-year-old’s place in United’s plans. Now, interim boss Rangnick – who will remain a consultant to the club beyond the end of this season – has revealed he has held plenty of talks with Cavani. In doing so, he has made it clear that the South American will be staying put. “We had a few conversations in the last couple of weeks – probably the player with whom I have spoken most,” Rangnick said. “I told him from the very first day that, for me, he is a highly important player. He is probably the only one who can play as a striker back to goal and face to goal. “And, as I said, his professionalism, his work ethic is just amazing and I told him that I desperately want him to stay until the end of the season. He knows that. He also knows how highly I rate him and how highly I respect him, and that was also the reason why I played him from the beginning together with Cristiano. Man Utd, Liverpool and Newcastle stars among 10 who need January moves Cavani will ‘definitely not’ leave “He knows that I will definitely not let him go. I would rather have another Edi on top of that but for me it’s clear that Edi has to stay.” Across his entire spell with United so far, Cavani has contributed 19 goals and six assists from 49 appearances. Between the Premier League and Champions League, he has two goals from 10 games so far this season. United are having to manage his workload carefully, though. Indeed, Rangnick recently revealed the centre-forward had asked not to start a game against Newcastle on Monday 27th December due to fitness doubts. He subsequently featured from the start in their next game, against Burnley three days later. It seems Cavani will have more opportunities to add to his tallies between now and the end of the season. By then, he will have reached the end of his contract at Old Trafford.

A sequel to Kill Rock Stars’ original 1991 compilation which featured the likes of Bikini Kill, Nirvana and the Melvins, Kill Rock Stars’ new album ‘Stars Rock Kill (Rock Stars)’ sees a host of bands covering tracks from the label’s impressive 30-year catalogue. The Washington-based label had been sharing the covers throughout 2021 but with the release of Annabelle Lord-Patey’s cover of Elliott Smith‘s 1995 song ‘Crazy Fucker’ yesterday (January 1), the project is now complete and available to stream/purchase via Bandcamp. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kill Rock Stars (@killrockstarsofficial) Speaking about the project, the label said: “In 2020 we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the eponymous Elliott Smith album by inviting artists we admire to record covers of the songs on that album. We had so much fun with that project that we’ve decided for 2021 to celebrate our 30th anniversary by expanding the idea to encompass the entire Kill Rock Stars release history.” ‘Stars Rock Kill (Rock Stars)’ sees The Cribs cover Comet Gain‘s ‘Finger-Nailed For You’, Shamir take on Laura Veirs’ ‘Where Gravity Is Dead’ and Deerhoof cover both Sleater Kinney (‘Don’t Talk Like’) and LiLiPUT (‘Hitch-Hike’). “KRS has an enormous catalogue,” Deerhoof said of their cover choices. “How do you choose? Something about the Sleater-Kinney song though, we had to try it. We wanted to celebrate one of these magic moments when they sounded like they didn’t quite know what they were doing…when emotions were revelations, and dissonances collided in some mystery universe between intention and accident. We relate to that part of us that works just like a child. We wanted to take a question mark of a song and not answer it.” In return, the likes of Wilco’s Nels Cline, Shutups, Shaylee and Death Cab For Cutie’s Dave Depper have put their spin on various Deerhoof tracks. Speaking about their inclusion on the compilation, The Cribs wrote: “Incidentally, the primary motivation behind the first-ever Cribs recording back in 2001 was to make a demo for KRS as a submission for the ‘Fields and Streams’ compilation… but we got too nervous and never sent it in.

The Channel 4 series follows amateur potters as they attempt to impress the judges with an array of wonderful creations.  Whether it be behind the pottery wheel, or perfecting intricate crafts before they face the uncertainty of the kiln, the potters always experience plenty of jeopardy on the way to creating something special. There are 12 potters taking part in the Channel 4 show, which begins its 10-week run on January 2. But what time is it on, who is hosting and how does the series work? Who is hosting the series?  Ellie Taylor and Siobhan McSweeney will host the new episodes (Picture: Channel 4) This year, the hosting duties will be split between comedian Ellie Taylor and Derry Girls star Siobhán McSweeney. Previous hosts of the programme have included Sarah Cox and Melanie Sykes. How does the Great Pottery Throw Down work? The contestants will have their work cut out this year (Picture: Mark Bourdillon) The series follows a similar format to The Great British Sewing Bee, and sees the contestants faced with challenges designed to test their skill sets. Each of the tasks are set by judges Keith Brymer Jones and Rich Miller. The first episodes will see the potters asked to make a children’s crockery set and ceramic milk bottles. After seeing their creations, the judges then decide who goes home and who gets to progress to the next stage of the competition.  Fans of the series will remember that Jodie Neale named the winner of The Great Pottery Throw Down 2021 after impressing the judges with their delicate work with clay. The previous final saw her tasked with creating a 1920s Art Deco-inspired party set for their main challenge. What time does The Great Pottery Throw Down air?

The theme song from The Karate Kid, “You’re the Best” by Joe Esposito, even inspired one of the storylines. L to R: Ralph Macchio and Xolo Maridueña | Netflix Creators Josh Heald, Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz spoke with Showbiz Cheat Sheet by zoom on Dec. 2 about Cobra Kai Season 4. Heald and Schlossberg addressed how one of the recurring themes of the series actually comes from “You’re the Best.” ‘You’re the Best’ takes on new meaning in ‘Cobra Kai’ Season 4 “You’re the Best” plays in the All-Valley Karate Tournament montage in The Karate Kid. The lyrics say, “History repeats itself, try and you’ll succeed. Never doubt that you’re the one and you can have your dreams. You’re the best around. Nothing’s gonna ever keep you down.” Well, history repeats itself in Cobra Kai Season 4 when Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith) returns to Cobra Kai. The Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fangs even repeat some of their old rivalries. “You want to put characters through the works,” Heald told Cheat Sheet. “You literally want to have history repeat itself as ‘Best Around’ tells us. And see it differently through different eyes now that you’ve matured or have harbored a resentment or have changed for better or worse, when you experience the same feelings again at a different point.” Samantha (Mary Mouser) and Tory (Peyton List) are repeating their rivalry. Hawk (Jacob Bertrand) finds himself bullied all over again. Combining dojos certainly hasn’t made Daniel (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny (William Zabka) any more harmonious. RELATED: ‘Coba Kai’ Season 4 Fan Favorite Cameo Brought Back Season 1 Vibes, Creators Say “Whether it’s one of the kids from one season to the next being back in a viscous cycle once again with a relationship or with a rivalry, this show more than most gives you an opportunity to explore how a rivalry and how adult conflict can actually change, can actually be overcome,” Heald said. “Sometimes it’s blunt force trauma and sometimes it’s the right mentor and sometimes it’s learning a mistake from the wrong mentor.” “You’re the Best” may be correct Cobra Kai seems to be all about letting go of the past. Johnny had to lose Cobra Kai to really move forward. Amanda (Courtney Henggeler) certainly encourages Daniel to let go of those old rivalries. However, as “You’re the Best” states, you might want the good parts of history to repeat themselves. “Do you want to totally let go of the past?” Schlossberg said. “We kind of need our past in some ways to learn from our mistakes. I would say it’s more about the relationship that we have with our past. For Johnny, it’s clearly something that’s haunted him at the outset of our series. It’s coming to terms with your past, whatever that means. It’s taking the good but not letting the bad overwhelm your life that you’re held back as a result of it. So the past is always there and it always can come up and there’s always something that could rear its ugly head.” ‘Cobra Kai’ Season 4 continues to recontextualize the past  One of the pleasures of Cobra Kai is seeing them rewrite the Karate Kid franchise. In season 3, they were able to give Ali (Elisabeth Shue) better closure than The Karate Kid Part II did. In Cobra Kai Season 4 they explained Silver’s outrageous Karate Kid III behavior. Cobra Kai shows no mercy.

That’s never going to change unless we build a time machine and go there and who knows?’” Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet",['Cobra Kai'],https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/cobra-kai-season-4-inspired-karate-kid-song-youre-the-best.html/,,cheatsheet

Smith writes about his plan to add millions to each release, and he was right. It worked,","Will Smith box office hits have been a staple of Hollywood since the ’90s. He had eight movies in a row gross over $100 million domestically, from Men in Black II to Hancock. But, it was his worldwide grosses that made Smith a billion dollar star. That wasn’t just good luck and good movies. Smith had a plan to add to the grosses of each of his movies, and it worked. L-R: Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones | Columbia Pictures/Getty Images Smith wrote about his plan in his new autobiography, Will. Here’s how he took big movies and made them Big Willie Style bigger. Will Smith box office was Will Smith success  Will Smith had a plan to conquer the box office after he’d conquered music and television. He picked the right movies, making Bad Boys, Independence Day and Men in Black hits. But, Smith also saw the value those blockbusters had to his own brand. RELATED: Will Smith Turned Down $10 Million to Star in a Bomb but Took a $300,000 Role Instead “The movie companies were putting up north of $150,000,000 to plaster the movie posters in every country in the world,” he wrote. “I would get to piggyback on their massive financial investment. In my mind, I was never promoting a movie – I was using their $150,000,000 to promote me. As far as I was concerned, the movie’s not the product here; I am the product. I was grateful to the movie companies for their investment in my future.” James Lassiter helped calculate the monetary value of worldwide releases James Lassiter was a producer involved with Smith’s career from the very beginning. Nothing they did was on a whim. They chose movies deliberately to pick blockbusters, and they also did the math on international potential.

It seemed like utter insanity to me. JL and I ran the numbers. We realized, for example, a film that might only earn $10 million in Spain could easily earn $15 to $25 million if you go to the country, do a premiere, a day of press, and a couple of fan events. (It doesn’t hurt if you learn a handful of phrases in the local language and say them on the news.) If you multiply that across thirty global territories, actually showing up in the countries could take a $250 million box office global potential north of half a billion dollars. Will Smith, Will, page 258-259 Will Smith box office grew exponentially The initial round of global publicity paid off, but it didn’t end there. Once Smith traveled the world promoting one movie, his subsequent movies did even better.  “As a gross participant, a portion of those extra dollars went directly into my pocket,” he wrote. “Not to mention, I became a bigger movie star in each specific territory, meaning that the net movie company would pay me more money than any other actor, because they knew I could double or maybe even triple the bottom line through global promotions.” Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet",['Will Smith'],https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/will-smith-box-office-added-250-million-every-will-smith-movie.html/,,cheatsheet

304,Ramsdale: Arsenal can challenge PL elite after City ‘domination’,2022-01-02,Arsenal suffered a last gasp 2-1 … The post Ramsdale: Arsenal can challenge PL elite after City ‘domination’ appeared first on Football365.,"Aaron Ramsdale insists Arsenal can challenge the Premier League elite if they continue to put in performances akin to Saturday’s narrow loss to leaders Manchester City. The Gunners suffered a last-gasp 2-1 defeat as Rodri turned home in injury time after Riyad Mahrez’s controversial penalty had cancelled out Bukayo Saka’s opener for the home side. READ MORE: BT Sport failed us all on Arsenal v Manchester City When the two teams met at the start of the season, City ran out comfortable winners but – despite playing against 10 men for over half an hour following Gabriel Magalhaes’ sending off – they were matched by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. The home side, with manager Mikel Arteta watching on from home having tested positive for Covid-19, dominated the first half and led at the break through Saka’s fine finish. They would ultimately come up short as City racked up an 11th consecutive league win but Ramsdale believed Arsenal showed enough to prove they can mix it with the best this season. “(There are) a huge amount of positives,” he told the club’s official website. “Not too many teams have dominated Man City like that more in the first half than we did it. “We played really well in the second half and we need to try and get over the line in one of these big games, but at the start of the season when it’s 4-0, 5-0, Liverpool, City, this is a massive step in the right direction. “We need to win one of these games, but ultimately we know we’re not challenging with these guys at the moment, but on this basis, if we can put that in week in, week out, we can be.” City’s win did not come without contention, their penalty awarded after referee Stuart Attwell consulted his pitchside VAR monitor, something he opted against doing when Martin Odegaard went down following a challenge from Ederson in the first half. “I felt it was soft,” Ramsdale said on the penalty which was awarded for a foul by Granit Xhaka on Bernardo Silva. “The linesman said he didn’t think it was a penalty, but then they get told to go and check it by VAR. “I’m more annoyed about the fact that they didn’t tell them to check ours in the first half on VAR. “The referee might have said ‘no penalty’ anyway, but in game time, both times it was ‘no penalty’ for them and us, but he gets to go and check theirs and not ours. That’s where my frustration is, the inconsistency between one decision and the other.”   The post Ramsdale: Arsenal can challenge PL elite after City ‘domination’ appeared first on Football365.","['All The News', 'Arsenal', 'Front Page', 'Home Page', 'News', 'aaron ramsdale']",https://www.football365.com/news/ramsdale-arsenal-can-challenge-pl-elite-after-city-domination,,football365
305,"Jake Paul escalates war of words with Dana White: ‘One of the most selfish, capitalistic motherf*ckers that I’ve ever seen’",2022-01-02,,"Jake Paul | Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images Jake Paul’s feud with Dana White shows no signs of slowing down. “The Problem Child” continued his war of words with White on Sunday, following a couple of intense exchanges over social media this weekend. Paul challenged the UFC president to raise fighter pay and provide long-term health care for his roster, vowing that he would end his own budding boxing career and step into the octagon with Jorge Masvidal if White accepted these terms. He also wants to see White drug-tested for the next decade. White responded later, repeating his previous claim that Paul is a steroid user, questioning whether Paul wrote his statement himself, and adding that he doesn’t believe Paul is a pay-per-view draw among other insults. Paul has since issued a response in which he blasts White for not addressing his specific points. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jake Paul (@jakepaul) “Long story short, you address nothing that I said,” Paul said on Instagram. “I accepted your challenge. I said I would fight MMA. I said that I would retire from boxing and you avoided all of that sh*t. … It shows that you are in a corner. You’re a dog in a corner trying to fight to save his whole company and the embarrassment that I’ve put you through. Everybody sees it and what you can’t accept or love or appreciate is that I’m trying to change the sport forever and you are one of the most selfish, capitalistic motherf*ckers that I’ve ever seen and everybody else needs you, Dana. I’m the only person that doesn’t need you and I don’t give a f*ck about you but all these people, all your fighters, all of them, they can’t say sh*t ‘cause you’ll just bench them. You met your maker. I’m not gonna stop. Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.” “The bottom line, Dana, is that you won’t add health care for your fighters because you don’t give a f*ck about them and you’re too much of a greedy b*tch to pay your minimum fighter more than $12,000 for risking their lives,” he continued. “It’s what a janitor makes. You need to pay them $50,000, Dana. Stop avoiding my points.” Paul reiterated that he would welcome a fight with Masvidal in MMA, though he disagreed that Masvidal is a legitimate pay-per-view attraction, claiming that his mother is a bigger draw than the UFC’s “BMF” champion. “You have been caught with cocaine and hookers every other week,” Paul said. “And you think that, like, with all the money that you have, like, ‘billionaire’ or some sh*t, that you would get some f*cking Botox ‘cause your forehead looks like a motherf*cking GPS Google Map. Like, all the lines in it and sh*t. “And you say Masvidal is a pay-per-view superstar. Let’s go to his last Instagram post, 5,000 likes or 10,000 likes or some sh*t. Do you realize that my mom Pam gets more likes than your pay-per-view superstars?” Regarding White wanting to see Paul tested for steroids, Paul welcomed the challenge, calling himself “a fat b*tch.” He then turned the question back on White and suggested that White’s accusations are based on the fact that Paul was able to knock out former UFC champion Tyron Woodley and former UFC welterweight contender Ben Askren. “I don’t do steroids and I take it as a compliment because there’s no other excuse to me knocking out all of your champions than ‘This kid does steroids,’” Paul said, later adding, “If you steroid test me, then I want to steroid test every one of your fighters. You won’t do it though, will you?” Paul also leaped to the defense of his manager Nakisa Bidarian, a former employee of White’s that was also mentioned in White’s most recent retort to the YouTube star. In doing so, he also made sure to take a few more personal shots at White. “Men lie, women lie, Dana White lies, numbers don’t,” Paul said. “You want to talk sh*t about my manager, who is the CFO of your company that helped you sell it to Endeavor for four billion dollars? “You’re just a jealous, ugly f*ck. You don’t know what true happiness is. You’re the definition of a f*cking unhappy billionaire who thought that money was gonna make their lives better. I feel bad for you.”",,https://www.mmafighting.com/2022/1/2/22863468/jake-paul-escalates-war-of-words-dana-white-the-most-selfish-capitalistic-motherf-ckers-ever-seen,,mmafighting

Read Full Article at RT.com","Iranian letter to the UN wants it to explore legal avenues and adopt a resolution condemning the US for the 2019 killing of General Qassem Soleimani Iran has urged the United Nations to take formal legal action against the US for the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani ahead of the two year-anniversary of his killing, which brought the two countries to the brink of war. In a letter to the UN General Assembly on Saturday, the legal department of the Iranian presidential office called for “all legal initiatives within its authority,” including the “adoption of a resolution” to condemn such killings and to “take measures to prevent such crimes in the future.” The missive, which stated that then-US President Donald Trump had openly claimed responsibility at the time, said American governments have long exhibited an “extreme unilateralism.” It also accused Washington of infringing upon international laws and regulations while the “international community remains silent.” This dangerous move by the US government came while the UN Charter, as a fundamental document and basis of international consensus in the post-War period, prohibits governments from engaging in acts that are detrimental to international peace and security. The letter warned that international peace would be in “even more danger” if the “perpetrators of the terrorist attack are free to walk with impunity.” According to Fars news agency, Iran’s chief civilian prosecutor has indicted several individuals in connection with the assassination, including Trump, the head of US Central Command General Kenneth McKenzie Jr., and former US secretaries of state and defense, Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper. Read more Protesters mourn assassinated general by burning US flags At a service for Soleimani on Saturday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that his “assassins, including Trump and the like” will be consigned to “history’s garbage bin” after paying “retribution in this world for the crime they committed.” After the January 2020 airstrike, Trump had called Soleimani “the world’s top terrorist” who “should have been terminated long ago.” Although he cited Iranian-backed plots on American interests in Iraq, officials later admitted that Soleimani was merely “saying bad things” about the US. In July 2020, a report by the UN rapporteur for extrajudicial killing concluded that the killing was “unlawful,” “arbitrary,” and in violation of the UN charter. Last year, Iran called on Interpol to issue “red notices” against US officials, including Trump.",,https://www.rt.com/news/545010-iran-warns-danger-soleimani-assassination/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,,rt

311,"Vicky Pattison reveals how alcohol took over her life, with up to 10 drinks a day: ‘I was not in a fit state to work’",2022-01-02,'I was jeopardising everything I’d ever wanted and worked for.',"Vicky has spoken about how alcohol consumed her (Picture: Rex) Vicky Pattison has said she ‘jeopardised everything’ as drink took over her life. The reality TV queen found fame aged 22 on MTV’s Geordie Shore before she was crowned Queen of the Jungle on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! in 2015. However, the Newcastle-born influencer has said she felt ‘lost and alone’ after the win and hated the person she became, downing up to ten drinks a day. Speaking to the Sun on Sunday, Vicky revealed: ‘I had everything I ever wanted. The public liked us, I’d left behind Geordie Shore and I had this new shiny career.’ However, the star said she was ‘convinced that people would realise I wasn’t anything special’ and that her new career would subsequently be taken away from her, leading her to a pattern of self-sabotage through alcohol. ‘I was turning up late for jobs. I don’t think I ever turned up drunk, I always slept, but I was not in a fit state to work,’ she admitted. ‘When you’re doing talk shows you want to be witty and warm, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not still shaking off the lethargy of five gin and tonics.’ The star admitted that she was ‘convinced’ people would relaise she ‘wasn’t anything special’ after finding fame (Picture: Getty) She added: ‘Once in a while you can put it down to the Geordie charm but, consistently, it’s just unprofessional. That’s what I was becoming. I was jeopardising everything I’d ever wanted and worked for.’ Describing people who get ‘mortal drunk’ as ‘always sloppy or aggressive’, the TV personality described herself as ‘a gross amalgamation of all of those when I was drunk’. Vicky then said she’d ‘get rid of’ her hangover and ‘shame’ with another drink, continuing the cycle.

312,Why is the EU banning coloured ink for tattoos and will the UK follow suit?,2022-01-02,Th-Ink twice.,"Tatts all, folks (Picture: Getty) Tattoos – some people can’t get enough of them, and others have compared it to slapping a bumper sticker on a Bentley (that was Kim Kardashian, of course). Wherever you stand on the issue, tattoos have become a topic of conversation lately, as the EU is set to ban the use of a range of coloured inks from January 4– they are, quite literally, making the case for tattoos a black and white issue. But will the UK ban coloured ink too? Here’s all we know so far… Why are coloured tattoos being banned? The reason for the ban comes down to the chemicals found in the coloured ink used for tattoos. The EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) had 4,000 chemicals typically used in colourful tattoo ink prohibited in January 2020. Tattoos with coloured ink will be banned in the EU from January 2023 (Picture: Getty) The regulatory body said the chemicals – some of which are already banned in products applied on top of the skin – can cause ‘cancer or genetic mutations’. REACH have made an effort to clarify that ‘the aim is not to ban tattooing but to make the colours used in tattoos and permanent make-up safer’. Ink suppliers have been given until January 4 2023 to find different, REACH-approved chemicals to create the same colours. Are colourful tattoos being banned in the UK? The UK is not immediately following the EU’s lead on the ban. The UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is encouraging tattoo manufacturers and artists to submit information about tattooing safety, and the ingredients found in tattoo ink. UK lawmakers want to know more about the subject before deciding on whether they, too, will outlaw certain chemicals found in inks. Before any decision is made, UK lawmakers issued a Call for Information in late 2021, a survey that people in the tattoo industry could fill out. Tattoo experts, Tattooing101.com, report that, if the UK tattoo ink ban is passed in 2022, there will be a year-long grace period for tattoo artists to start using alternative tattoo ink ingredients. {""@context"":""https:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""VideoObject"",""name"":""Metro.co.uk"",""duration"":""T11S"",""thumbnailUrl"":""https:\/\/i.dailymail.co.uk\/1s\/2021\/08\/22\/09\/46958095-0-image-a-14_1629619743812.jpg"",""uploadDate"":""2021-08-22T09:08:31+0100"",""description"":""That's unfortunate."",""contentUrl"":""https:\/\/videos.metro.co.uk\/video\/met\/2021\/08\/22\/2187895933157684643\/480x270_MP4_2187895933157684643.mp4"",""height"":270,""width"":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video What chemicals are in tattoo ink? Tattoo inks consist of pigments combined with a carrier. Manufacturers are not required to reveal their ingredients or conduct trials, but it’s widely reported that professional inks may be made from iron oxides (rust), metal salts, or plastics.  Heavy metals used for colours include mercury, lead, nickel, zinc, aluminium, titanium, copper, iron, and barium. Other elements used as pigments can include arsenic, lithium, selenium and sulphur. Typical carriers are ethyl alcohol or distilled water. Signs of ink poisoning When components of improperly tested tattoo ink affect the body, you could suffer from ink poisoning. Symptoms of ink poisoning can vary, and Authority Tattoo explain that poisoning from tattoo ink is often mistaken for an infection, with symptoms like pain, swelling or a rash. Ingredients like titanium oxide, used in ink to lighten certain shades, can cause inflammation and delayed healing. This will present itself as the raised skin or itchiness often experienced with white tattoos. Dry or flaky skin is another symptom, with severe cases exhibiting blisters and hardened areas of skin. If you’re having a bad reaction to a new tattoo, it’s always wise to consult a doctor (Picture: Getty) What to do if your tattoo is making you ill Chances are, you’ll know pretty soon if you’ve had a bad reaction to your tattoo. In most cases, poisoning will present itself as a minor inflammation and can be treated with rest, ice and elevation. Over the counter anti-inflammatories will help after getting a new tattoo. Many cases of suspected tattoo ink poisoning turn out to be an allergic reaction or infection, rather than poisoning but if you’re ever unsure, consult with a doctor. In cases where poisoning is suspected, it will normally be treated with a course of antibiotics.

314,"Souness rips into Lukaku with rant as pundit fears for Tuchel, Chelsea season",2022-01-02,"Graeme Souness has hit out at Romelu Lukaku following his recent comments about Chelsea and his future The post Souness rips into Lukaku with rant as pundit fears for Tuchel, Chelsea season appeared first on TEAMtalk.","Graeme Souness has said that there is nothing worse for a player to do to his club mid-season than what Romelu Lukaku has done at Chelsea. The 28-year-old made headlines when he moved back to Stamford Bridge in the summer. Following a struggle for chances in his first spell, he had to prove himself at Everton, West Brom, Manchester United and Inter. And after starring at Inter, Lukaku expressed his delight at being able to prove himself back at Chelsea as the Blues looked to plug arguably the only gap in their squad with a striker in his prime. But despite a fast start with three goals in three Premier League games, he then suffered injury. Since his return, he has only netted two goals in six games and mostly played as a substitute. And Lukaku’s situation took a major turn for the worse when he admitted that he has become unhappy at his situation. He also revealed his wish to move back to Inter – and not towards the end of his career. Speaking in response to the comments, Souness slammed the Belgium international. “I can’t tell you a worse thing that a player can do at this moment in the season,” the pundit told Sky Sports (via the Daily Mail). “To come out and say basically I don’t want to be here, I don’t want to play with players I’m playing with anymore and the manager. And how that damages Chelsea going forward, it has to.” Souness added: “He’s 29 years old he’s not 19 he should know better. It’s totally disrespectful. It damaged the football club enormously. It damages the manager.” Blues boss Thomas Tuchel responded to Lukaku by saying that the comments are “not helpful”. What’s more, he took action by dropping the striker from the squad for Sunday’s huge clash with Liverpool. Nevertheless, Tuchel admitted that he does not want to turn the situation into more of a headline-grabbing situation than it already is. Tuchel speaks out on Lukaku comments The manager said: “We don’t like it, of course, because it brings noise that we don’t need and is not helpful. “But on the other side, we don’t want to make more out of it than it actually is. “You know very well how it is, it’s very easy to take lines out of context, to shorten lines to make headlines, then realise later it’s not so bad or what he meant. Celebrating players who didn’t celebrate – Salah, Lingard, Ronaldo and more “But let’s be honest, we don’t like it, because it’s noise we don’t need, we need a calm environment. “I don’t feel him unhappy; I feel the exact opposite. If you ask me yesterday morning, I would say he is absolutely fine.” Chelsea go into Sunday’s clash with Liverpool a point behind the Reds, who are eight off Premier League leaders Manchester City.   The post Souness rips into Lukaku with rant as pundit fears for Tuchel, Chelsea season appeared first on TEAMtalk.","['English Premier League', 'Top Story', 'All The News', 'Front Page', 'Chelsea', 'Homepage', 'Romelu Lukaku', 'Graeme Souness']",https://www.teamtalk.com/chelsea/romelu-lukaku-slammed-graeme-souness-comments-fears-tuchel-season,,teamtalk

319,‘West Side Story’ Has Been Banned in 6 Countries and Critics Think They Know Exactly Why,2022-01-02,"Six countries' citizens will not be able to see 'West Side Story' in theaters, but director Steven Spielberg doesn't seem to concerned about it.","West Side Story premiered to rave reviews and plenty of award nominations. But not everyone will get the chance to see this stunning piece of cinema. Steven Spielberg‘s retelling of a classic tale — itself a retelling of an even older classic tale — won’t appear in at least six countries. While the exact reason for the ban hasn’t always been explicitly stated, fans are pretty sure they’ve figured it out. The West Side Story ban has to do with the choice to provide LGBTQ representation in the latest version of the tale of star-crossed lovers.  ‘West Side Story’ is a fresh take on an old tale (L-R) Carol Lawrence, Rachel Zegler, and Rita Moreno at a premiere Of West Side Story | Jon Kopaloff/WireImage West Side Story first premiered as a Broadway musical in 1957. While the setting might seem nostalgic now, it was actually a modern-day version of Romeo and Juliet during its premiere. Instead of the warring Capulets and Montagues, West Side Story places the two lovers on different sides of teenage street gangs: the Puerto Rican Sharks and the white Jets. With catchy tunes and dance numbers that left audiences amazed, the original became a flashy film in 1961 when it won multiple Academy Awards. When Spielberg was first recognized as an incredible director, he hoped to recreate West Side Story one day. Fastforward to 2021 and the director premiered the much-anticipated remake of the classic story. For a film so beloved and decorated, the stakes were high. But critics have largely been impressed with Spielberg’s take. Critics have remarked on its ongoing cultural relevance and heaped praise on the supporting cast and dancers.  Several countries banned ‘West Side Story’ Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” banned in multiple Middle Eastern countries https://t.co/xend9AfdOr— Salon (@Salon) December 8, 2021 Despite the primarily positive reception, several countries have banned West Side Story from premiering. As Deadline reports, the list of countries prohibiting the film includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and the UAE. In some of these countries, the condition of release involves a list of cuts requested from Disney, which distributed the film. But Disney allegedly refused to make the cuts, so the movie will not get a theatrical release in these countries.  It’s widely believed the cuts and the bans are related to the character Anybodys, a transgender character. As ScreenRant reports, Spielberg’s adaptation has Anybodys “played by non-binary actor Iris Menas.” The character “is no longer a tomboy and is instead a trans man, fixing a major problem with the character in the original.” While the original character fell flat and didn’t make much sense to many critics, this update changes things: “Instead of the story being played for laughs as a girl tries to be one of the boys, it’s a serious and heartfelt story of a trans man seeking acceptance and trying to prove himself to the Jets.” The inclusion of Anybodys as a trans man is likely the bans’ source.  Other award-winning films have faced international bans 15 Hollywood Movies Banned in Other Countries, From #WonderWoman to 'Noah' (Photos) https://t.co/qsi6QpEWFS pic.twitter.com/nWLQjjL7E2— TheWrap (@TheWrap) June 2, 2017 West Side Story is far from the only film to receive a ban. The Culture Trip explains that movies have gotten banned for many reasons. For example, Ireland and Singapore banned A Clockwork Orange for decades because of its violent nature. Similar concerns kept The Texas Chainsaw Massacre out of West Germany and Singapore. Sometimes, censored versions of the film are allowed instead, but other works are considered unacceptable in any form. As for works banned for LGBTQ representation, many Middle Eastern countries as well as China banned Brokeback Mountain. The UAE, as Gulf News reports, tends to ban films with excessive sexual content regardless of the sexual orientation of the characters or actors. When a movie has too much sexual content to reasonably edit out, the country has a tendency to prohibit it entirely — a fate suffered by Black Swan and Love and Other Drugs.  RELATED: 15 Movies Banned in the U.S. Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet",['Steven Spielberg'],https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/west-side-story-banned-6-countries-critics-think-know-exactly-why.html/,,cheatsheet
320,Video: Luis Ortiz knocks out Charles Martin in bizarre finish,2022-01-02,,"Luis Ortiz defeated Charles Martin by 6th round TKO in Florida. | PB on FOX PPV Screenshot It’s not often you see a knockdown where a fighter can’t get up because his glove got stuck. Premier Boxing Champions kicked off the new year with an all-heavyweight pay-per-view card in Florida, and the main event certainly delivered some twists and turns. Luis Ortiz (32-2-2 NCs, 27 KOs) was dropped twice by former IBF champion Charles Martin (28-3-1, 25 KOs) over the first four rounds. Admittedly they were flash knockdowns but still they were knockdowns of the Cuban. Then things got wild in round six, as Ortiz rocked Martin with a left hand and time stood still for Charles. His whole body pretty much went into freeze mode and yet the fight was not stopped when Martin clearly had no idea where he was. Ortiz poured on the pressure and the punches to score the knockdown. Martin’s glove got tangled in the ropes, which halted the count and allowed Martin some extra time to recover. You could tell though that his legs were wobbly and he did not have his bearings. Sure enough a second knockdown followed (with some shots to the back of the head definitely connecting), and the ref ended the fight before completing the eight-count. Martin didn’t like it but arguably the fight should’ve been stopped before the first knockdown.

322,Arsenal eye up Villa star after Arteta requests new holding midfielder,2022-01-02,Luiz is into his third season … The post Arsenal eye up Villa star after Arteta requests new holding midfielder appeared first on Football365.,"Arsenal are considering a move for Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz in the January transfer window, according to reports. Luiz is into his third season at Villa Park after joining from Manchester City in 2019 and has impressed immensely. Mikel Arteta is thought to be an admirer, while City have even made attempts to bring him back to the club since his departure. BT Sport failed us all on Arsenal v Manchester City It was reported in November that he wanted to leave the club amid interest from Roma, and now The Sun claim Arsenal are plotting a move. Newcastle are also thought to be keeping tabs on him. Arteta is seeking reinforcements in the defensive midfield department with Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny having left for the Africa Cup of Nations. Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Denis Zakaria is another option for the Gunners, but Luiz boasts Premier League experience. The Brazilian, who has 18 months left on his Villa deal, would initially partner Granit Xhaka in the middle of the park.     Despite giving away a needless penalty in Saturday’s 2-1 defeat to City, Xhaka has enjoyed a resurgence of late and has even been touted for the captaincy following Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s dismissal. Andy Gray, though, feels he can’t be trusted, even with all his experience. Speaking after the City game, he told beIN SPORTS: “If you look at who committed the crimes here, it was two of the more senior players. “Certainly Xhaka at 30 plus has not got the excuse of youth and naivety. He’s just nuts at times, he really is. “You can’t rely on him. He’s given away a stupid penalty today with really poor defending. “Gabriel, he’s not old but he’s experienced as well. He should know better. Don’t give the referee an opportunity to send you off.” Arsenal’s stand-in head coach Albert Stuivenberg said of the result and performance: “Well, upset that we don’t end up with three points from this game. “That’s the most frustrating part. At the same time, we are very proud about the performance of the players.” Arsenal face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semi-final on Thursday.     The post Arsenal eye up Villa star after Arteta requests new holding midfielder appeared first on Football365.","['All The News', 'Arsenal', 'Aston Villa', 'Front Page', 'News', 'douglas luiz', 'Mikel Arteta']",https://www.football365.com/news/arsenal-eye-douglas-luiz-mikel-arteta-requests-midfielder-aston-villa,,football365
323,Romelu Lukaku could push for January transfer with Chelsea’s Premier League rivals on his radar,2022-01-02,The striker's future is up in the air after his controversial interview.,"The striker’s future is up in the air after his controversial interview (Picture: Getty) Romelu Lukaku could seek a January transfer away from Chelsea depending on the punishment dished out to him for his controversial interview, with a move to a Premier League rival reportedly a possibility. The Belgium international conducted an interview with Sky Italia three weeks ago, which was only released on Thursday, in which he said he ‘was not very happy’ with his situation at Chelsea. Lukaku also aimed a dig at manager Thomas Tuchel for playing ‘a different formation’ and made a number of comments saying he hoped to return to former club Inter Milan while he is still in the prime of his career. Tuchel isn’t happy with Lukaku over his recent interview (Picture: Getty) Tuchel was understandably not happy with the timing of Lukaku’s comments – or the content – and has reacted by dropping the forward from his squad to face Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. The recriminations may not stop there, either, with Chelsea’s hierarchy prepared to back their manager over the dispute by docking his wages, with everyone at the club taking a dim view of the interview. According to ESPN, the punishment Chelsea decide to dish out could have huge consequences for Lukaku’s future at Stamford Bridge. Although the 28-year-old did not conduct the interview with the intention of forcing a move away, least of all in January, if he continues to be omitted from the squad – and fined – then the situation could ‘prompt a change of heart’.

Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, meanwhile, suggest a summer move is the more likely outcome and even claim he could be tempted to follow Antonio Conte, his old boss at Inter, to Chelsea’s rivals Tottenham. Lukaku thrived under Conte and the Spurs boss was asked about his old charge on Saturday, telling Sky Italia: ‘I feel great affection for him but he’s a Chelsea player.’ Lukaku will play no part against Liverpool on Sunday (Picture: Getty) Discussing the situation with Lukaku, Tuchel told Sky Sports: ‘I will not try to tell you that we are happy about it. Does a dressing room always need to be a sensitive dressing room? Does it always need to be full of harmony? No. It’s sometimes even good if it’s not always in full harmony. ‘But to speak out on these things, as a big player and as a big signing and as a key player for us – who behaves on a daily basis like he is absolutely happy – that is a concern of course, and it is very, very surprising. ‘We have to speak to him, he has to speak to us, so we can understand it. Because it is very hard to understand because how he behaves, how he plays, how he scores, even now right after injury, how he behaves on a daily basis, how we have talks with myself… it’s very surprising.’ MORE : Antonio Conte says he has ‘great affection’ for Romelu Lukaku after Chelsea criticism MORE : Former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell criticises Thomas Tuchel for dropping Romelu Lukaku for Chelsea vs Liverpool For more stories like this, check our sport page.

324,‘The Bold and the Beautiful’: Susan Flannery Wanted Stephanie to Die in Brooke’s Arms,2022-01-02,"It's been nine years since the death of 'The Bold and the Beautiful' character Stephanie Forrester, and Stephanie's final scenes turned out the way Susan Flannery wanted it.","It’s been nine years since The Bold and the Beautiful said goodbye to Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery). After 25 years, Flannery decided to retire, which meant the end of her iconic character. The writers did a tremendous job of paying tribute to the Forrester matriarch. Stephanie’s death remains one of the most talked-about moments in the show’s history. Katherine Kelly Lang and actor Susan Flannery I Barry King/FilmMagic ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ star Susan Flannery loved Stephanie Forrester’s death scenes Stephanie’s death aired on the November 26, 2012, episode of The Bold and the Beautiful. After discovering her lung cancer had returned and progressed worse, Stephanie decided to forego treatment. In her final weeks, Stephanie reminisced about Eric Forrester (John McCook) and their children about the good times. A party was held a the Forrester mansion celebrating Stephanie’s life, then afterward, she and Eric embarked on a trip to Big Bear. When Eric returned to Los Angeles to take care of business, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) agreed to stay with Stephanie. The two sat outside on a bench and recalled their tumultuous history before making peace. As Brooke cuddled and sang to Stephanie, the Forrester matriarch died. RELATED: ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’: 5 Character Deaths That Had Fans in Tears Stephanie dying in Brooke’s arms remains a hot topic with fans. Although some viewers disagreed with the decision, Flannery was happy with how it played out. In a 2013 interview with TV Guide, Flannery discussed her final scenes. “I went up to Brad’s office and said, ‘You’re gonna have Brooke there with her at the end, right?’ He looked up and gave me this great big grin and said, ‘Yes, that’s who it is.’ I said, ‘Fabulous!’ I think it worked out really well.” Stephanie Forrester and Brooke Logan’s rivalry Stephanie versus Brooke is The Bold and the Beautiful‘s most epic feud. The women were at each other’s throats for over two decades. The basis for their rivalry was Brooke’s relationship with Stephanie’s eldest son Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye). Stephanie disapproved of Brooke and believed Taylor Hayes (Krista Allen) to be the better woman for her son. Their feud escalated when Brooke married Eric and Stephanie’s other son Thorne Forrester (Ingo Rademacher). The two had vicious fights over the years, with Stephanie delivering one of the famous slaps to Brooke. While the women often feuded, they did make peace, and Stephanie showed compassion to Brooke. During Stephanie’s final years, she and Brooke became friends, and their bond lasted until the end. Susan Flannery and Katherine Kelly Lang are friends in real-life While their characters often fought on The Bold and the Beautiful, Flannery and Lang are friends in real life. Although Flannery is no longer with the show, she, Lang, and other co-stars meet to catch up on old times. Aside from being a friend, Flannery was also a mentor to Lang during the actor’s early years on the soap opera. It is always so special to spend time with this incredible woman!

327,Overcoming being overwhelmed: EuroCross Academy blog,2022-01-02,Samantha Scott discovers how to stop worrying and just race,"After a one-year hiatus, the Euro Cross Academy (ECA) returned to Belgium this week, with 10 junior riders from the United States embarking on a near three-week racing stint to get their first experience of European cyclo-cross.Cyclingnews is running a blog from the camp, with riders contributing throughout their Belgian adventure and the ninth installment provided by 17-year-old Samantha Scott. In the women's junior race at the GP Sven Nys in Baal, the Californian finished in 8th place. For updates from the ECA, follow on Instagram: EuroCrossAcademyIG; Twitter: EuroCxAcademy and EuroCrossAcademy.com.***As I stood on the side of the Namur World Cup course, I watched as everyone around me successfully made it down the famous off-camber descent. My face burned with jealousy. I had already taken multiple attempts down this section, none of which were successful. Watching my competitors succeed made my mind jump to the idea of not being selected for the Worlds Team. I had never felt this overwhelmed for a race.Later that night, I consulted with my coach. We went through my accomplishments thus far that helped me get selected for Namur. He told me that everyone is going to make mistakes, but I can surprise myself by racing my own race. Read moreEvery position counts: EuroCross Academy blog Change is epitome of 'cross: EuroCross Academy blog Comparison of cultures: EuroCross Academy blog Adapting to disappointments: EuroCross Academy blog This was a turning point for me. From this moment forward, my confidence improved alongside better results. Throughout the trip I have come across multiple situations where I was overwhelmed, but this motto to race my own race resets me.I applied this mantra to Zolder’s elite women’s field. This race went really well for me because I didn’t get caught up in who was around me. The start was hectic, filled with 120 of the top racers in the world. After I saw the green light, I navigated through the pack. This was a big moment because I only worried about where I was instead of who was around me. I didn’t come into this race with a goal in mind which took off tons of pressure as I was able to focus on my own ride.I then brought this positive momentum into Baal the following weekend. This time I lined up with 36 of the best 17-18 junior women in the world. While this was one of the smaller races we did, it was one of the most difficult courses I've ever done. Instead of getting overwhelmed like I did at Namur, I tackled the course one section at a time.Over the course of this trip I have found my rhythm in racing. I have learned how to overcome mental blocks by focusing on racing my own race. This is something I am looking forward to applying to my racing back home. I'm not only here for possible Worlds selection, but to learn and be the best I can be.",,https://www.cyclingnews.com/blogs/samantha-scott/overcoming-being-overwhelmed-eurocross-academy-blog/,,cyclingnews

READ MORE: Wonder Woman 1984 review: a smart and stylish superhero sequel with lots of heart Gadot reprised her role as Wonder Woman in Wonder Woman 1984, which was released at the end of 2020, with a third film in the series already confirmed. To mark the end of 2021, Gadot shared a video of highlights from her year, which fans have been inspecting and believe holds a clue to her future plans. In the July section, she shared a photo of her in a make-up chair, which features a crew member in the background wearing a maroon lanyard. Fans have pointed out that similar lanyards have been seen in posts by the directors and crews of upcoming DC movie The Flash, which they believe Gadot will appear in as Wonder Woman.

Speaking at the DC FanDome’s Multiverse 101 panel, the Birds of Prey writer said: “The cinematic multiverse is going to be born out of this movie, born out of Barry’s story.” Ezra Miller (Justice League) expanded on the potential scope of the new direction, which could involve different versions of popular characters and retelling of events. “This movie, by opening the door that Flashpoint did in the comic, all of these stories and characters can start to collide,” he said. Rumours that Flashpoint’s time-travel plot could be used as the basis for the new film were not dampened by news that both Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton are set to return to playing Batman in The Flash. In a four-star review of Wonder Woman 1984, NME said: “It’s a smart and stylish sequel that’s endlessly entertaining; but more than that, in the dumpster fire of 2020, Wonder Woman 1984 is a two hours of hope filled escapism – something all of us could do with right now.” The post Gal Gadot hints at Wonder Woman appearance in new DC movie appeared first on NME.",,https://www.nme.com/news/film/gal-gadot-hints-at-wonder-woman-appearance-in-new-dc-movie-3128387?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gal-gadot-hints-at-wonder-woman-appearance-in-new-dc-movie,,nme

332,Report: Pete Carroll-Russell Wilson Could Possibly Split in Offseason,2022-01-02,"The Seahawks have made two Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl XLVIII over the Broncos, over Wilson and Carroll's tenure together.","The Seahawks have made two Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl XLVIII over the Broncos, over Wilson and Carroll's tenure together.View the original article to see embedded media.Sunday’s game vs. the Lions could mark the last home contest in which coach Pete Carroll and quarterback Russell Wilson work together.According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, there is a league-wide feeling Carroll and Wilson will not be together again next season.The two have been together since 2012, when Seattle drafted Wilson in the third round. Wilson has a 102-53-1 regular season record over that span. The Seahawks have made two Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl XLVIII over the Broncos, during his tenure.Last offseason there was countless speculation about Wilson’s future with the franchise. Wilson reportedly did not demand a trade from the Seahawks, but the Bears, Raiders, Saints and Cowboys made up a list of teams his agent said he would have wanted to go to had a deal happened. According to The MMQB’s Albert Breer, Wilson alluded to the desire for more control over how he wanted to finish his career, and where he saw things going during exit meetings last year.Earlier this week, Wilson acknowledged his uncertain future, saying, “I know for me personally, I hope it’s not my last game [in Seattle]. But at the same time, I know it won’t be my last game in the NFL.""Wilson missed three games in October because of a finger injury and has been inconsistent at times this season. He has completed 65% of his passes for 2,639 yards, tossing 18 touchdowns and five interceptions. He is under contract for two more years for $51 million.Carroll is under contract through the 2025 season.The Seahawks (5-10) will finish the ‘21 season with a losing record for the first time since 2011, and have recorded double-digit losses for the first time since 2009, the year before Carroll was hired.Kickoff for Sunday’s game vs. Detroit is set for 4:25 p.m. ET.More NFL Coverage:John Madden’s Style—and Impact—Will Never Be ReplicatedJakob Johnson, the German Import Helping Define the Post-Tom Brady PatriotsThe Sad Ballad of The Fighting EkelersSeahawk Maven: Can Seahawks Pull Off One-Year Reload?For more coverage of the Seahawks, visit Seahawk Maven","['Wire', 'pete carroll', 'Breaking', 'Russell Wilson', 'NFL', 'NFL', 'Seattle Seahawks']",https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/01/02/seahawks-pete-carroll-russell-wilson-future-franchise-split,,si

334,EU flag taken down after backlash in France,2022-01-02,"Conservative rivals of French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU flag underneath the Arc de Triomphe in Paris was an attack on “French identity,” and was taken down soon after the wave of outrage. Read Full Article at RT.com","The flag of the European Union was removed from the Arc de Triomphe after protests from conservative politicians Conservative rivals of French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU flag underneath the Arc de Triomphe in Paris was an attack on “French identity,” and was taken down soon after the wave of outrage. President Emmanuel Macron’s office told French media that the blue flag with 12 golden stars was removed on Sunday “in accordance with the planned schedule.”Secretary of State for European Affairs Clement Beaune also denied that the removal was related to the backlash from conservatives. “I’m proud that this symbol was displayed under the Arc de Triomphe,” he said. The European flag was placed under the monument on New Year’ Eve to mark the beginning of France’s six-month presidency in the Council of the European Union, one of the bloc’s decision-making bodies. France has assumed the role for the first time since 2008. Government buildings and cultural landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, the Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre, were illuminated in blue for the occasion. Read more French presidential contender asks Macron to take down EU flag Several right-wing politicians, including Macron’s rivals in the upcoming presidential election scheduled for April, said it was disrespectful to place the EU flag instead of the French tricolor on the Arc de Triomphe, a war memorial adjacent to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Valerie Pecresse, a presidential candidate from the Republicans party, protested against the “erasure of the French identity” and urged that the EU flag be removed. Marine Le Pen, also a candidate and former leader of the National Rally party, accused Macron of “arrogant contempt for our history.” After the flag was taken down, Le Pen tweeted that the removal of the EU flag was a “beautiful patriotic victory at the dawn of 2022,” thanking the “massive mobilization of all those who love France and the Republic.”",,https://www.rt.com/news/545009-france-eu-flag-removed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,,rt

336,Rangnick reveals talks with Man Utd star amid exit links,2022-01-02,Van de Beek has featured for … The post Rangnick reveals talks with Man Utd star amid exit links appeared first on Football365.,"Ralf Rangnick has revealed he has held talks with Donny Van de Beek at Manchester United over his future at the club. Van de Beek is yet to start a Premier League game this season and has featured for just six minutes under Rangnick in the competition. The Dutchman has been consistently linked with a move away from Old Trafford, with rumours of a loan in January. READ MORE: The Mailbox has got a case of the BT Sports But Rangnick says he wants to keep the midfielder until the end of the season at least and insists he will get a chance to shine. “Well, just work hard,” Rangnick said when asked about how the Holland international can get into his side. “So far as I have got to know him he’s got a top mentality, he works hard in every training session. “He’s a team player through and through and there will be games where he will get his chance to play I’m sure. “I also had a longer conversation with him last week about that and, again, of course it’s difficult for him right now because he also wants to play for the Dutch national team. “He wants to qualify for himself and play in the World Cup in Qatar and in order to do that he needs to get game time here. “But I still believe that we should keep him, that he should stay here, definitely until the end of this season and try to get as much game time as he possibly can.” Rangnick also confirmed that Edinson Cavani will stay at the club but concedes Anthony Martial will be allowed to leave if the right offer comes in. The France international has expressed his desire to leave United and Rangnick has left the wantaway forward out of recent squads. “He made it very clear that he wants to leave and, in a way, I can understand his wish to leave and to try to play more regularly somewhere else,” Rangnick said. “But, again, it’s a question not only of what he wants to do but it’s also a question of which kind of clubs are interested in him and do they meet the demands of the club, so we have to wait and see. “He is not injured currently so I decided to go for this group of players that were in the squad (against Burnley), so it had nothing to do with injuries.”   The post Rangnick reveals talks with Man Utd star amid exit links appeared first on Football365.","['All The News', 'Front Page', 'Home Page', 'Manchester United', 'News', 'Donny van de Beek', 'Ralf Rangnick']",https://www.football365.com/news/rangnick-reveals-talks-man-utd-van-de-beek-transfer,,football365

Read Full Article at RT.com,"UFC great Khabib Nurmagomedov has produced a short and sharp response to Tony Ferguson after the man he almost fought five times tried to troll him UFC fighter Tony Ferguson has been told that he is a serial loser in a stinging response after he tried to engage in a near-unintelligible war of words with Khabib Nurmagomedov. In their lightweight pomp in the UFC, the pair were meant to meet a number of times before injuries and other issues deprived fans of a potentially classic bout in the 155lbs division. With Khabib retiring on 29-0 in 2020 and Ferguson losing his three most recent matches in the space of little more than a year to the likes of contenders Justin Gaethje and Beneil Dariush and current champion Charles Oliveira, 'El Cucy' is on the verge of being cut by the elite promotion's president, Dana White. The near-impossibility of the two men facing off in the octagon has not stopped them from continuing to take potshots at one another and maintaining a long-standing feud. Approaching the end of 2021, Ferguson share a video on social media of Spiderman dancing on the New York Subway and wrote: ""Pump, pump it up. Pretty sure old fathead got in his fix for the good stuff [food]. ""Doesn't he know that sh*t will go straight to his hips? So fat he had to make a new weight class.

Ferguson also appeared to repeat a suggestion that Nurmagomedov dodged a date with him on the night he ultimately lost to Gaethje – even though the Dagestani was unable to travel because of transport chaos at the start of the pandemic. Nurmagomedov responded to the outburst a few days later, though by reminding his foe of the last time he won a fight.

The pair were not expected to feature until the New Year, but this latest update will come as a big blow for Bielsa, who has been without both players since the Whites’ 2-2 draw with Brentford at the start of December. Phillips has appeared in just 12 Premier League matches this seasonGETTY Speaking ahead of their clash with Burnley, the Argentine was asked if the recent fitness issues in the squad, which had seen the club’s last two matches postponed, would force Leeds to be active in the January transfer window. The 66-year-old said: “We have been recovering players, even if Phillips and Cooper will return in March. “And even if (Jamie) Shackleton and (Charlie) Cresswell come back towards the end of January or early February, the amount of players we have is increasing. “We will see whether during January an alternative comes up which we may take advantage of.” Cooper’s absence has also been a huge blow for BielsaGETTY When later quizzed on whether Cooper and Phillips returning in March was a worst-case scenario, Bielsa replied: “No, that is what we expect.” Injuries and Covid-19 cases saw Leeds’ scheduled fixtures with Liverpool and Aston Villa postponed, but Bielsa was able to provide better news on some of the other absentees. Junior Firpo is available after suspension, while Diego Llorente, Robin Koch and Dan James are also retuning. “For the following game, we recover Junior, James, Diego Llorente, Koch had already returned and (Jack) Harrison also, who basically in the last game didn’t play because he picked up an injury as soon as the game started but he has also recovered,” Bielsa said. Bielsa has plenty to consider in the days and weeks aheadAFP Patrick Bamford was another to suffer an issue during that costly 2-2 draw with Brentford but he is fit again. Boss Bielsa was, however, cautious about using last season’s top goalscorer this weekend, given his previous return was short-lived. He added: “This is the fourth week since Patrick’s injury. “Patrick is healthy but he hasn’t played for four weeks now and it puts in doubt the convenience of him playing without having done any football training sessions.” With Leeds’ injury and COVID-19 problems clearing up, Bielsa has no doubts about the clash with Burnley going ahead. Prior to their enforced two-week break, the Yorkshire club had lost heavily to Manchester City and Arsenal with depleted squads, but their Argentinian coach is refusing to view the last couple of weeks as a positive for his players, especially those who contracted coronavirus. “The illness of a group of players can never be considered positive even if after it generates alternative consequences that can be valued, because what provokes it is sufficiently serious to not value it,” Bielsa said. “Up until now we think the game will go ahead because the reason for the two postponements, we think we are on the way to coming back from those reasons why they were postponed.” Get The EDGE talkSPORT EDGE is the free football app that keeps you one step ahead of your mates with short, sharp and shareable content.

The Belgian forward has made all the headlines of late after an interview, conducted three weeks ago but only released this week, saw him criticise Thomas Tuchel and declare his plans to return to Inter Milan. Lukaku openly admitted he was ‘unhappy’ at a lack of playing time and the system Tuchel has been playing of late with the German boss describing it as ‘noise they don’t need right now.’ Former Blues striker Hasselbaink isn’t impressed either about Lukaku, who has netted seven goals this season, showing disrespect to his current club. ‘I don’t understand that, I really don’t understand,’ he said on Sky Sports. ‘That is fine having frustration that you’re not playing. How you react to that is coming in at Aston Villa and making and showing the difference. Romelu Lukaku has been dropped by Thomas Tuchel for today’s clash with Liverpool (Picture: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images) ‘Every player is going to go through bad spells, every player is going to have injuries, and if you’ve not come back the way that you should the manager has got the right to not play you. ‘It’s four matches, to spit your dummy out after four matches and you want to go back to Inter because they have sorted you out when you came from Man Utd… ‘If you really wanted to stay at Inter then say I’m not going to Chelsea, give me half my wages and I’ll stay.

343,Man Utd suffer double blow as wantaway man stuck and youngster snubs move,2022-01-02,Barely two days into the January window and the Red Devils' transfer plans have taken a hitch on two fronts The post Man Utd suffer double blow as wantaway man stuck and youngster snubs move appeared first on TEAMtalk.,"Manchester United has suffered a double blow as a wantaway man is stuck at Old Trafford and a young star has snubbed their advances. Barely two days into the January window and the Red Devils‘ transfer plans have taken a hitch. They have a number of unhappy players who want out in 2022. And one of them, Donny van de Beek, looked set to leave this month. However, that will be no longer happening because of issues surrounding his change of agent earlier this season, as per The Mirror. The midfielder cut ties with long-term adviser Guido Albers in October. He had failed to secure an exit to Everton. However, Albers has refused to relieve Van de Beek of the two-year contract he signed 18 months ago. Therefore, fellow agent Ali Dursan is unable to represent the Dutch international and get him a move away until the summer. That means Van de Beek will remain on the sidelines for more time after an already shambolic start to his United career. Ralf Rangnick is said to have disregarded him. So the club are having to pay the wages of a player they otherwise would happily sell on. Celebrating players who didn’t celebrate – Salah, Lingard, Ronaldo and more Not only has that issue arisen, but the Red Devils have also lost out on signing 18-year-old Ricardo Pepi. The American wonderkid was eyed up by them and their Premier League rivals Liverpool – but both have been beaten. As per Fabrizio Romano, Pepi is set to join German side FC Ausburg on a permanent move from FC Dallas. His exploits for his national team and in the MLS have earned a league-record fee of $20m, with adds on included as part of the deal. The striker travelled with his agent to Munich. He is undergoing a medical on Sunday before putting pen to paper on a five-year deal. Of course, United or Liverpool may once again pursue him during that time. United hope grows for Rice Meanwhile, United have become more confident over a massive deal for Declan Rice following West Ham’s recent poor form, according to a report. The midfielder has emerged as one of the most sought-after Premier League stars with his rise in recent seasons. After making his top-flight debut at the end of the 2016/17 season, he has racked up 150 outings in the competition. What’s more, the 22-year-old has become a vital part of the England team and starred at Euro 2020. As a result, United have had eyes on Rice for some time over a potential move to Old Trafford. And this summer could finally be the time they nab him… READ MORE: Ralf Rangnick takes action as Man Utd sixth sense sees huge midfielder deal prepared   The post Man Utd suffer double blow as wantaway man stuck and youngster snubs move appeared first on TEAMtalk.","['English Premier League', 'All The News', 'Transfer News', 'Promos', 'German Bundesliga', 'Front Page', 'Homepage', 'Manchester United', 'Donny van de Beek', 'Ricardo Pepi']",https://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/donny-van-de-beek-ricardo-pepi-double-blow-transfer-news,,teamtalk

345,New Year's Day ranks 1st holiday car thefts,2022-01-02,– AAA said New Years day is the number one holiday for car thefts. The association reports Oklahoma ranks 7th highest in the nation for car thefts on January 1st.,"OKLAHOMA (KFOR) – AAA said New Years day is the number one holiday for car thefts. The association reports Oklahoma ranks 7th highest in the nation for car thefts on January 1st. “Why not make your New Year’s resolution to keep your keys with you and to always lock your vehicle?” said Leslie Gamble, a spokesperson for AAA. New Year’s Day is a time for celebration and renewal, but it’s also the prime opportunity for thieves to pop open a car door, hop inside, and take off. “New Year’s Day is the number one holiday for vehicles to be stolen,” Gamble said. Metro apartment complex without heat for months as winter blast nears Gamble told News 4, Oklahoma ranks 7th highest in the nation for stolen cars on the holiday. Crooks take advantage of drivers parking their cars in unfamiliar places. “Perhaps vehicles being left somewhere with people not taking them home after a party at night, being at a different place, or not in their home garage or space,” she said. AAA said pick-up trucks are at the top of the thieves wish list in Oklahoma, including full-size models from Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, and GMC. “So if you’re a pickup owner, you really need to make this your New Year’s resolution that you lock your vehicle,” she said. One of the top things AAA wants to make sure car users never do is keep the car running with the keys inside. That includes using the keyless feature. While it’s convenient for you, it’s also convenient for a crook. “It’s pretty easy when you consider what the paint point is if you don’t,” Gamble said. “In Oklahoma last year, claims rose close to $10,000 per vehicle that was stolen.” With the temperature dropping this New Year’s weekend, AAA said keeping an eye on your car’s upkeep is a must. Here’s when gas prices are expected to peak in 2022 “There will be a lot of batteries that will be failing and there will be tire pressures that have changed,” Gamble told News 4. If you’re enjoying this weekend indoors while letting your car sit outside unused, you could have a headache when trying to start the car up Monday morning. “We might be surprised by a failed battery or tire pressure being low,” she said. “And you’ll probably at this point, want to go out and start it every once in awhile before you have to go somewhere.

In other words, it sounds like the 5G we've been waiting for.</p><p>In the letter penned by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to AT&T CEO John T. Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vesterberg, they acknowledge the investment in 5G-C made by both companies but caution:</p><p>""...the economic stakes for the aviation industry and the disruptions the traveling public would face from the commercial launch of C-Band service on January 5 are significant, particularly with the ongoing stress and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.""</p><p>The letter notes that the impending rollout could be particularly problematic during ""periods of low visibility and inclement weather,"" where it could lead to the air travel industry diverting, disrupting, and even canceling flights.</p> <p>In a separate statement, the FAA said it's, ""working with the aviation and wireless industries to find a solution that allows 5G C-band and aviation to safely coexist.

However, since many modern smartphones, including the iPhone 13 and Samsung Galaxy s21, already support 5G C-Band, there is a chance that AT&T and Verizon customers near these 5G C-Band stations could start noticing improved 5G speed and reliability before the spring.</p> <ul><li><a href=""https://www.techradar.com/best/best-5g-phones"">Find the best 5G phones</a></li></ul> </article>",,https://www.techradar.com/news/the-dot-wants-to-tap-the-brakes-on-5g-c-band-rollout/,,techradar
347,Is 2022 the year we ditch making resolutions?,2022-01-02,Less people are bothered about participating in the annual ritual of goal setting.,"Embrace being you just as you are this year (Picture: Getty) ‘What will your New Year’s resolution be this year?’ It’s a question that usually pops up at some stage – whether it’s genuinely asked by a friend or an acquaintance in a desperate bid for small talk – but something seems different this year. Less people are bothered about participating in the annual ritual of goal setting. According to US News & World Report, the failure rate for resolutions is around 80%, which doesn’t bode well. With most of us falling flat by mid-February, is it worth gearing up for disappointment? There are ways to better your chances at sticking to resolutions, but self-improvement and growing doesn’t need to happen every January 1 – it stands a better chance of being successful when inspired by something more personal, anyway. So this year, more people are saying ‘stick it’ to making resolutions and instead are embracing themselves for exactly who they are. In the days leading up to New Year’s Eve, an old viral video of Gemma Collins resurfaced on social media, in which she says: ‘I’m not getting involved. I’m here to enjoy myself … I just wanna be me.’ Over on Twitter, people have been sharing similar thoughts. One person wrote: ‘no new year’s resolution this year as i’ve recently discovered I’m perfect and I require no changes’. How I sleep not making any New Yearâ€™s resolution pic.twitter.com/r3G9DY3yOs— 9GAG (@9GAG) December 31, 2021 Someone replied: ‘this is my attitude too. can’t imagine getting to a place where I like myself more!’ ‘Why would anyone think it’s possible to start a New Year’s resolution on a day where you’re hungover,’ another asks. Someone else jested: ‘no New Year’s resolution this time, not gonna lie to myself and pretend like i have the strength to improve at all’. ‘I have no resolutions this new year. It’s the year’s turn to try,’ another said. It’s less about arrogantly assuming there’s no room for improvement (note the jokey tone in these Tweets), but more about talking kindly to oneself instead of starting the year with a desire to change. Research from personal finance comparison site, Finder, found that 46% of Brits aren’t making any resolutions this year. https://www.instagram.com/p/CYI34SuKdak/ The older someone is, the more likely they are to fall in this camp, the survey found. Gen Z are most likely to set goals at 87%, while by the time you get to baby boomers it’s just 17%. Finder believes the fact we’re still in the throes of the pandemic could be an answer as to why, given that an air of uncertainty still lingers over rules and restrictions. Also, some might still feel the deficit of being ‘fun starved’ for so long over 2020 and 2021, leaving the common New Year’s resolutions of saving money and eating healthily less desirable – there’s still lost time to make up for.

Caroline Plumer, a psychotherapist, says: ‘On paper, it’s a highly positive thing to focus on moving forward and reaching your full potential. ‘However, there can be obstacles on the way and this can lead to real disappointment.’ By avoiding goal setting at a time when it feels like you ‘should’ rather than ‘want’ to, you’re less likely to set targets you won’t meet. ‘Pat yourself on the back for making contact with that recruiter or cooking that delicious veggie meal,’ she says. ‘Focus on what you are achieving on the journey, not just the ultimate goal.’ Self-appreciation is paramount, no matter what.

A few months into the season, they could not have been more wrong. The Chicago Bulls have exceeded all expectations this season. Currently having a healthy 24-10 record, they sit on top of a very competitive Eastern Conference. One main reason for their success this year has been the emergence of summer signing DeMar DeRozan. The 4x All-Star has been exceptional with the Bulls this year, averaging 26.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 4.6 assists. The star has recently been in the limelight as he hit back-to-back game-winners against the Pacers and Wizards. Check out the clips here: Due to his impressive performances, the 32-year-old is almost a lock for a spot in the All-Star game this season, making it his fifth appearance. However, when he signed with the Chicago Bulls this offseason, the move was not well received by many. In fact, various NBA executives and scouts thought the signing was the ‘worst move’ of free agency. Oh boy! They could not have been more wrong with this take. While hindsight is 20/20, not even his biggest fans would have seen this coming.

The Chicago Bulls’ front office doubled down this summer after trading for All-Star Nikola Vucevic at the end of last season. The Bulls orchestrated a sign-and-trade to land Lonzo Ball from the New Orleans Pelicans. Moreover, they signed former LA Lakers guard and fan favourite Alex Caruso in free agency. However, the biggest splash came when the Bulls made another sign-and-trade to bring DeMar DeRozan to the Windy City to partner up with Zach Lavine on a three-year deal worth close to $82 million. Walking buckets. pic.twitter.com/ekUfzhO50J — Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) September 27, 2021 When the deal went down, many were quite skeptical of the move. In fact, DeRozan was voted as the ‘worst move’ of free agency. A few months into the season, DeRozan has made everyone eat their words, guiding his team to the top spot in the East. The DeRozan move strikes me as pretty insane for the Bulls. He’ll be on a bad contract, they gave up a 1st to get him, and I’m not even sure how much helps their offense due to off-ball limitations. And the less said about their defense with LaVine, DeRozan, and Vuc, the better — Nate Duncan (@NateDuncanNBA) August 3, 2021 So far, his contract looks like a bit of a steal. Moreover, his fit with Lavine has been nothing short of exceptional. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether this fit will work in the post-season. However, from what we have seen to date, there is every reason for Bulls fans to be optimistic.

WASHINGTON, Jan 2 — The congressional committee investigating last year’s Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol is “looking into” issuing subpoenas to Republican members of Congress to force their cooperation, the panel’s chairman said today.Representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, said on NBC’s Meet The Press that the committee is examining whether it can lawfully issue subpoenas to sitting members of Congress.“I think there are some questions of whether we have the authority to do it,” Thompson said, according to an interview transcript. “We’re looking at it. If the authorities are there, there’ll be no reluctance on our part.”Thompson is chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Jan. 6, which is expected to hold public hearings and issue reports in the coming months.The Select Committee is trying to establish then-President Donald Trump’s actions while thousands of his supporters attacked police, vandalized the Capitol and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives. Congress had been meeting to count the electoral votes giving Democrat Joe Biden the victory in the November 2020 presidential election.Multiple people close to Trump, including conservative media TV hosts, urged him during the riot to make a televised speech telling his supporters to stop the attack. Trump waited hours before releasing a prerecorded message.The committee on Dec. 22 sent a letter to Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican and ardent Trump ally, asking for testimony about his telephone conversations with Trump on Jan. 6.Jordan said in a recent Fox News interview that he had “real concerns” about the committee’s credibility, but was reviewing its letter to him.The request comes two days after a similar letter to Republican Representative Scott Perry.The committee requested Perry’s testimony about Trump’s attempts to oust Jeffrey Rosen, who was acting head of the US Justice Department during the closing weeks of his presidency, and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, an official at the time who tried to help Trump overturn his election defeat.Perry declined to cooperate, posting on Twitter that the committee “is illegitimate, and not duly constituted.”An appeals court ruled earlier in 2021 that the committee was legitimate and entitled to see White House records Trump has tried to shield from public view. — Reuters","['us republican party', 'capitol attack']",https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2022/01/02/jan-6-committee-looking-into-subpoenas-for-us-republican-lawmakers-says-cha/2032569,,malaymail
